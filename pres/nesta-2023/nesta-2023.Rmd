* .tuos_purple[Child poverty is the strongest single predictor of child protection involvement and children being in the care system, and this effect was stonger in neighbourhoods within more affluent local authorities.]

* Spending on services for supporting families upstream have been cut dramatically since 2010, with the poorest places faces the steepest cuts.

* Children from some ethnic groups are disproportionately represented in the child protection system (.grey[and it's not just because their families are poorer on average])

A 1SD increase in neighbourhood deprivation was associated with a 1.7 times increase in CLA rates. A 1SD increase in LA deprivation was associated with a 1.3 times increase in CLA rates.

Some things I learned in the process:

* By and large: local authorities and the people working in them don't win policy/resource arguments on national statistics.
* "Prove it's happening here" isn't a challenge to you, it's a challenge they face from national bodies.
* Local authorities are OBSESSED with comparing themselves to other local authorities.
* My (overboard) solution...
