# Some key terms

All rates refer to average rates at 31st March of each financial year.

.strong[Children looked after rate] .off_white[refers to the rate of children in care per 10,000 child population, unless otherwise specified. This could be care in a foster home, residential home, or in supported independent accommodation.]

.strong[Child protection plan rate] .off_white[refers to the rate of children on a child protection plan per 10,000 child population. A child protection plan usually follows a section 47 enquiry where a safeguarding assessment by a local authority social worker or social work team finds that a child requires a plan according to the statutory guidance.]

.strong[Child in need rate] .off_white[refers to the rate of children with 'child in need status' under Section 17 of the Children Act 1989 per 10,000 child population. This section of the Children Act places a duty on local authorities to provide additional support to children who are unlikely to achieve or maintain a reasonable standard of health or development, or whose health or development is likely the be impaired, without the provision of additional services, or, if the child has a disability.]

Preventative services spending .off_white[refers to spending on children's centres and children under 5; family support services; services for young people (including youth work, youth centres; substance misuse and teenage pregnancy services); and 'other' spending not related to children looked after, safeguarding, or youth justice.]

## The major reason why the findings from this study differ from those of other studies is that a **within-between** regression model is used, as well as the inclusion of a lagged term. 

A groundbreaking study, by Dr. Davara Bennett et al.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, used these models before to explore differences between one to four year olds and older children.

There are other differences discussed in the report, including the use of Bayesian statistics and multiple imputation. But the form of the model is the most important reason why the findings may differ.

## Differences in the substantive interpretation of coefficients:

`\(B'_w\)`  — What is the association between changes in `\(X\)` around the mean for groups `\(j\)` and changes in `\(Y\)` around the random intercepts estimated by `\(U_{0j}\)`?

`\(B'_b\)` — What is the association between group mean differences in `\(X\)` and group mean differences in `\(Y\)`?

*In this context*, the relationship between changes in spending/poverty **within** a local authority over time has with rates of intervention **within** that local authority over time, are separated from the relationship **between** local authorities average levels of spending/poverty and their average rates of intervention.

## Does spending on preventative services reduce child welfare intervention rates?

Each £100 decrease in family support, youth services, children's centres, and other preventative services per child was associated with an .turquoise_dark[increase of around 3.5 children in care per 10,000 over the following two years]...

And around .ipse_gold[a 2 per 10,000 increase in the number of children placed on child protection plans (between 2009-10 to 2021-22)].

Decreased spending in a given year was associated with higher children in need rates the following year, but lower rates in the same year between 2009-10 and 2021-22.

### Average reductions in spending on preventative services between 2009-10 and 2021-22 can explain approximately .turquoise_dark[60%] of the average increase in children looked after rates within local authorities. 

Between 2014-15 and 2021-22 reductions in spending can explain around one third of the increase in children looked after rates, with increases in child poverty able to explain nearly the entire remainder of the observed increase.

## Between 2014-15 and 2021-22...

It is possible to include variation in .turquoise_dark[rates of children living in low income families] within local authorities over time.

Every £100 per child spent on preventative services was associated with a **0.18 percentage point decrease in children in low income families in the same year, and a 1.38 percentage point decrease in children in low income families in the following year**.

The median local authority saw a 4.1%p increase in children in low income families between 2014-15 and 2021-22; around **one fourth of this increase can be attributed to cuts in services to support families with children**.

## The "cost" of investing in support

**'Costs' associated with children being looked after are notoriously difficult to estimate. The moral and human costs of not supporting families should outweigh any economic costs.**

A £100 per child increase in spending on preventative services would cost approximately £1.11billion in England.

Of this, we might expect around **30%** of the costs to be returned through reductions of children in care (at £77,200 per child per year) and improved mental health (Ford, et al. 2007) and criminal justice outcomes (Leyland, et al. *forthcoming*) alone.

According to estimates by CPAG, we would expect reductions in child poverty to result in returns of approximately **£3.05billion**; **275%** of the investment.

### When spending on preventative services is low, more spending on safeguarding services tended to lead to increased rates of children in care

In years with **average levels of preventative spending** within local authorities, a £100 per child increase in safeguarding (child protection social work) spending was associated with a **3.69 per 10,000 increase** in children looked after rate.

By contrast, in years where spending **was £200 per child higher** than average, a £100 increase in safeguarding spending per child would be predicted to be associated with a **negligible 0.09 per 10,000 increase**.

### In 2009-10 and 2010-11, around 28 percent of local authorities had preventative services spending that was £200 or more higher per child than average between 2009-10 and 2021-22

There was also evidence that **higher spending on preventative services could attenuate the relationship between increases in child poverty and children in need rates**.

**Before 2012**, a £100 per child increase in preventative and supportive services within a local authority was associated with around a **2 to 2.2 per 10,000 decrease** in children looked after rate; a **2.6 to 2.8 per 10,000 decrease** in child protection plan rate; and **4.6 to 5.9 per 10,000 decrease** in children in need rate. The effect was also more consistent across local authorities.

Between around 2013 and 2017, there was no strong evidence that increased spending was associated with decreased rates of intervention.

Between 2017 and 2022, spending was associated only with increasing effectiveness for reducing children looked after rates, from a **2.3 per 10,000 reduction to a 7.9 per 10,000 reduction** per £100 per child.
