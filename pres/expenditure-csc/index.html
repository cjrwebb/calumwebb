## Greater investment in preventative services (family support, early help, children's centres) in a given year* is associated with significant decreases in Children in Need rates and 16-17 year olds starting to be looked-after the following year, as well as increased odds of 'Good' or 'Outstanding' Ofsted ratings.

## Am naïve enough to think that it could be useful for convincing policymakers and resource gatekeepers that these services are worth investing in.


???

I am going to focus on what each piece of research says and why it's better than the other claims that have been made by Ofsted and NAO.

&gt; # "Our inspectors have seen this across the country and we now know that: Inadequacy is __not a function of size, deprivation or funding__, but of the quality of leadership and management."

&lt;br&gt;

&gt; &gt;  ### Sir Michael Wilshaw, Chief Inspector, Ofsted, 2016: 5


???

Not fair of me to pick on Michael Wilshaw in this way, but this quote basically summarises some of the resource-holder's perspectives on the evidence. This has also been the line of various National Audit Office reports on the association between spending and outcomes.

Plenty of research has shown the effectiveness of early help and family support services through a range of methods. 

But often this effectiveness is expressed in terms of psychometric outcomes, self-assessed efficacy, or qualitative evaluation. 

This is not the language of rates of intervention and therefore not a strong basis to build an economic case.

These three papers use meaningful population outcomes that economically-driven decision-makers respond well to when building a case.

### **Why** is it critical that we can make this case in the language that we need to make it.* This is a crisis.

### Children in Need rates and the Trouble with Thresholds (Devaney, 2019). Why we don't often look at CIN and why it's usually not reliable.
###  

.pull-left[

&lt;br&gt;

Local authorities interpret legislation for interventions, especially 'low-level' ones, differently. e.g.

Section 17 (10) of the Children Act 1989: __Definition of a 'Child in Need'__:

&gt; (a) he is unlikely to achieve or maintain ... a reasonable standard of health or development without the provision for him of services by a local authority .. 

&gt; (b) his health or development is likely to be significantly impaired, or further impaired, without the provision for him of such services... or;

&gt; (c) he is disabled.

???

However, this analysis was flawed because of some fundamental misunderstandings of how children become designated as Children in Need, and how services decide when to intervene.

Firstly, there are definitional problems -- terms like Children in Need are subject to local authorities' interpretation of legislation and, in the specific case of Need, this interpretation can be quite broad.

A significant factor in the numbers of interventions is the extent of __rationing of services__ within a local authority (Webb &amp; Bywaters, 2018; Devaney, 2019; Hood, 2020).

In practice, then, local authorities often ration many of their services, especially preventative or early help services, depending on the total amount of funding they have available -- in other words, need rates might often go down or be stable not because need has gone down, but because they are no longer able to have such an inclusive definition of need.

This means that relying on the relationships between cases may be unreliable -- higher levels of spending often correspond with higher rates of children in need, but using standard statistical models like those used by the National Audit Office does not recognise that that local authority may have a more inclusive defition of CIN and be more able to provide services.

What we really want to know is what happens to CIN rates _within_ a local authority when their expenditure on these services fluctuates above or below their stable level and trajectory.

### The separation of between-'unit' and within-'unit' components of individual change over time using the ALT-SR model (Curran, et al. 2014)

Fortunately, other observational studies in other research fields have been faced with this exact problem:

* How do you measure the effect of dietary changes on children's development when they are developing at different rates due to a number of measurable and unmeasurable indivdiual-level characteristics, like genetics?

* How do you measure the effect of alcohol consumption on wellbeing for a cohort that is ageing from late adolescence to adulthood?

This is where Curran, et al. developed the ALT-SR model to separate between-unit and within-unit components of change over time, to better identify within-unit dynamics. 

This partitions between-unit effects to a latent growth part of a structural equation model, and within-unit effects to a cross-lagged part of the model.

To my knowledge, I am the first person to apply this to local public services and populations as opposed to individuals.

### Higher spending per child in a given year was associated with significant reductions of Children in Need *within* local authorities, but this effect has weakened over the decade.

.pull-left[

* On average over the decade, __each additional £100__ in spending per child was associated with __a reduction of between 12 and 13 children ‘in need’ per 10,000 the following year__, around a 4 per cent reduction a typical local authority. Each increase of 1% in spending was associated with a 0.11% decrease in CIN rate the following year.

* After estimating this effect independently for each pair of years, __the effectiveness of spending on preventative services for children and young people was found to have declined to a point of non-significance beyond around 2015__.

* Spending cuts since 2010/11 can account for __between 13,000 to 16,500 more children and young people each year between 2010 and 2015 kept at risk of developmental or health impairments nationally__.

???

When we apply this model to rates of children in need and levels of spending on preventative services per child, we find a significant and contextually large effect that indicates higher spending per child within a local authority results in reductions in children in need the following year.

On average, an additional £40 spent per child on preventative services in a given year was associated with decreases of nearly 5 children in need per 10,000 (the average rate of children in need in a local authority is around 360 per 10,000, and the average expenditure per child over the decade was around £320).

However, we also find that this effect has been decreasing over the decade: this is despite a significant investment in two 'What Works' centres, with over £15million of government grants provided to the Early Intervention Foundation and over £30million in grants provided to the What Works Centre for Children's Social Care over the decade.

The [YMCA's Out of Service](https://www.ymca.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/YMCA-Out-of-Service-report.pdf) report suggests that services for older children and young people have been most strongly affected. 

  Rates of children looked-after have grown most in the 16-17 year old age group (almost 2 times in 10 years), where rates for 1—4 year olds have been relatively stable.

### The importance of quality

* Reduced rates of intervention would be of little comfort if they meant that children and families were going *without* support in the first place, rather than them no longer needing it.

&gt; ### .tuos_purple[The result is what [Seddon] calls ‘‘failure demand’’, as issues that are not resolved straightaway keep reappearing and cumulatively start to overload the system’s ability to cope. ... The analogy in the context of children’s services is with prevention/early intervention and patterns of referral and re-referral to specialist agencies (Lord, Southcott, &amp; Sharp, 2011). ... In Seddon’s terms, ‘‘failure demand’’ will start to mount up and put pressure on services, if interprofessional networks have been unable to intervene quickly and effectively at the point that families start to experience problems. In an example of the kind of negative feedback loop examined by Munro (2010, p. 13), this eventually has the counterproductive effect of increasing the number and severity of cases entering the system.]

Very often, we are focusing on the individual level and then generalising up to a population level -- assuming that if we do lots of what works for individuals we will make an overall effective system. The trouble is, it doesn't seem to work that way and the assumptions we make about the system itself - and how services work together - are often over simplistic. In reality, the children's social care system is much more like an ecosystem than a mechanical system — it should be approached more like a garden with an ecology that needs to be supported.

Our argument is that better quality systemic and structural information on the efficacy of 'big picture' funding is needed to make the case for more investment. Improvement *after* sufficient investment is also likely to be better, and to be based on better studies, because there are fewer issues of rationing and failure demand to contend with.
