# What is effectiveness?

.off_white[Throughout this report I use the term "effectiveness" to refer to the extent that spending on preventative services reduces rates of child welfare interventions.]

.off_white[However, we should not lose sight of the fact that this is] only one part .off_white[of what effectiveness means.]

.off_white[Effectiveness also means the extent to which services hear parent's, children's, and other family members' voices; respond to community needs; adhere to process; champion children's and human rights; challenge inequality and oppression, and many other things.]

Please keep this in mind when considering the findings and language.

# Some key terms

All rates refer to average rates at 31st March of each financial year.

.strong[Children looked after rate] .off_white[refers to the rate of children in care per 10,000 child population, unless otherwise specified. This could be care in a foster home, residential home, or in supported independent accommodation.]

.strong[Child protection plan rate] .off_white[refers to the rate of children on a child protection plan per 10,000 child population. A child protection plan usually follows a section 47 enquiry where a safeguarding assessment by a local authority social worker or social work team finds that a child requires a plan according to the statutory guidance.]

.strong[Child in need rate] .off_white[refers to the rate of children with 'child in need status' under Section 17 of the Children Act 1989 per 10,000 child population. This section of the Children Act places a duty on local authorities to provide additional support to children who are unlikely to achieve or maintain a reasonable standard of health or development, or whose health or development is likely the be impaired, without the provision of additional services, or, if the child has a disability.]

Preventative services spending .off_white[refers to spending on children's centres and children under 5; family support services; services for young people (including youth work, youth centres; substance misuse and teenage pregnancy services); and 'other' spending not related to children looked after, safeguarding, or youth justice.]

## Does spending on preventative services reduce child welfare intervention rates?

Each £100 decrease in family support, youth services, children's centres, and other preventative services per child was associated with an .turquoise_dark[increase of around 3.5 children in care per 10,000 over the following two years]...

And around .ipse_gold[a 2 per 10,000 increase in the number of children placed on child protection plans (between 2009-10 to 2021-22)].

Decreased spending in a given year was associated with higher children in need rates the following year, but lower rates in the same year between 2009-10 and 2021-22.

### Average reductions in spending on preventative services between 2009-10 and 2021-22 can explain approximately .turquoise_dark[60%] of the average increase in children looked after rates within local authorities. 

Between 2014-15 and 2021-22 reductions in spending can explain around one third of the increase in children looked after rates, with increases in child poverty able to explain nearly the entire remainder of the observed increase.

## Between 2014-15 and 2021-22...

It is possible to include variation in .turquoise_dark[rates of children living in low income families] within local authorities over time.

Every £100 per child spent on preventative services was associated with a **0.18 percentage point decrease in children in low income families in the same year, and a 1.38 percentage point decrease in children in low income families in the following year**.

The median local authority saw a 4.1%p increase in children in low income families between 2014-15 and 2021-22; around **one fourth of this increase can be attributed to cuts in services to support families with children**.

## Between 2014-15 and 2021-22...

The overall effect of spending on rates of children looked after remained broadly similar between 2014-15 and 2021-22, increasing slightly to a **3.86 per 10,000 decrease in children looked after rate for a £100 per child increase in spending within a local authority**

A **substantial amount of this was due to the effect of spending on reducing rates of children in poverty: 2.75 per 10,000 of the decrease**

However, during this time period, increases in spending tended to be associated with **increases in child protection plan rates**.

## The "cost" of investing in support

**'Costs' associated with children being looked after are notoriously difficult to estimate. The moral and human costs of not supporting families should outweigh any economic costs.**

A £100 per child increase in spending on preventative services would cost approximately £1.11billion in England.

Of this, we might expect around **30%** of the costs to be returned through reductions of children in care (at £77,200 per child per year) and improved mental health (Ford, et al. 2007) and criminal justice outcomes (Leyland, et al. *forthcoming*) alone.

According to estimates by CPAG, we would expect reductions in child poverty to result in returns of approximately **£3.05billion**; **275%** of the investment.

### When spending on preventative services is low, more spending on safeguarding services tended to lead to increased rates of children in care

In years with **average levels of preventative spending** within local authorities, a £100 per child increase in safeguarding (child protection social work) spending was associated with a **3.69 per 10,000 increase** in children looked after rate.

By contrast, in years where spending **was £200 per child higher** than average, a £100 increase in safeguarding spending per child would be predicted to be associated with a **negligible 0.09 per 10,000 increase**.

### In 2009-10 and 2010-11, around 28 percent of local authorities had preventative services spending that was £200 or more higher per child than average between 2009-10 and 2021-22

There was also evidence that **higher spending on preventative services could attenuate the relationship between increases in child poverty and children in need rates**.

**Before 2012**, a £100 per child increase in preventative and supportive services within a local authority was associated with around a **2 to 2.2 per 10,000 decrease** in children looked after rate; a **2.6 to 2.8 per 10,000 decrease** in child protection plan rate; and **4.6 to 5.9 per 10,000 decrease** in children in need rate. The effect was also more consistent across local authorities.

Between around 2013 and 2017, there was no strong evidence that increased spending was associated with decreased rates of intervention.

Between 2017 and 2022, spending was associated only with increasing effectiveness for reducing children looked after rates, from a **2.3 per 10,000 reduction to a 7.9 per 10,000 reduction** per £100 per child.

## Local authorities do not tend to have spending effects that reduce all types of intervention rates to similar extents.

There are some exceptions, for example, LAs in the Tees Valley or the cluster of Hampshire, Portsmouth, and Southampton, as well as stand-alone local authorities like Cumbria, Sefton, and Bradford. But it is more common for local authorities to see spending reduce some forms of interventions but not others.

There was some tendency for preventative services to be effective for reducing *either* child protection plan rates, or children in need rates, perhaps reflecting differential capacities to respond to more upstream needs.

This variation can help inform local policy and practice learning.

### There was moderate evidence that local authorities that had protected preventative spending had more effective services for reducing children looked after rates, on average.

There was a 93.4% probability that greater reductions in preventative spending between 2009-10 and 2021-22 were associated with less effectiveness per £1 per child invested in prevention.

### Between 2014-15 and 2021-22, the effect for one to four year olds was reversed, and the effect for children aged over 10 was far more muted, potentially due to the removal of the mediating factor of poverty.

The findings suggest that child poverty mediates a far greater extent of spending effectiveness for older children, and tends to be associated with much larger increases in rates of care for younger children.

## The predicted effect of a £100 per child increase in preventative spending varied dramatically between local authorities.

The figures on the right-hand side represent the **middle 50 per cent range** of the expected effects across local authorities in England.

While increased spending on preventative and supportive services is very likely to decrease rates of intervention across almost all age groups in a statistically average local authority, **this is not necessarily the case everywhere**.

## Local authorities tended to have a tendency towards spending that was *either* effective for reducing rates of care for younger children, *or* effective for reducing rates of care for older children.

One somewhat outlying correlation was between variation in the effectiveness for reducing rates of care for over 16 year olds and effectiveness for reducing rates of care for Under 1s, which may indicate the role that teenage pregnancy services have.

Further, there was a strong correlation between the effect of spending on care rates for female child and the effect of spending on care rates male children, indicating that local authorities with effective spending for reducing rates of care among male children also tend to have effective spending for reducing rates of care among female children, and *vice versa*.

### The effect of spending was more strongly associated with changes in rates of children from minoritised ethnic groups in care.

For Black children, each £100 per child decrease in spending was associated with a 4.1 to 5.6 percent increase in rates of care (equivalent to a 4.5 per 10,000 increase in rates of children in care); a 5 percent increase for Asian children (1.42 per 10,000); a 6 percent increase for mixed heritage children (5.83 per 10,000); and a 21 percent increase for 'other' ethnic groups (-19.67 per 10,000).

This implies that either .ipse_gold[a)] preventative and supportive services have become less effective for minoritised ethnic populations over time, and/or .ipse_gold[b)] the vast majority of the benefits of investing in support for these populations are mediated through the effect this spending has on child poverty.

## Children from minoritised backgrounds faced far more spatial inequality in the effect of spending across local authorities than White children.

Even if the average effect of investment in spending is more beneficial for minoritised populations, this was very spatially unequal.

## There was an alarming lack of correlation between the relationship between spending on preventative and supportive services and rates of care across different ethnic populations.

High correlation would indicate investment in preventative and supportive services, while variable, is approximately aligned across all ethnic groups. These relatively low correlations suggest that many local authorities have services that are associated with rates of children in care in very different ways depending on the ethnicity of the child population.

### Despite the fact that we might expect the relationship between spending and rates of care to be stronger in urban local authorities, this did not seem to be the case.

The relationship was broadly similar across local authorities in urban, rural, and rural with significant urban regions, with the relationship implying slightly more effectiveness in areas with at least some rurality. This may reflect differences in access to or the capacity of services, or the way experiences of poverty differ in ways where services may be more effective than cash transfers.

## The major reason why the findings from this study differ from those of other studies is that a **within-between** regression model is used, as well as the inclusion of a lagged term. 

A groundbreaking study, by Dr. Davara Bennett et al.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, used these models before to explore differences between one to four year olds and older children.

There are other differences discussed in the report, including the use of Bayesian statistics and multiple imputation. But the form of the model is the most important reason why the findings may differ.
