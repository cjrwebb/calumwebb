I am a quantitative social scientist at the University of Sheffield and study child welfare inequalities, systems, and policy. My research focuses on the association between poverty, family support services, and child protection.

I am a proficient user and teacher of R, Mplus, SPSS, and Stata, with specialism in structural equation modelling, multilevel modelling, and latent growth modelling with longitudinal secondary survey and administrative data.
