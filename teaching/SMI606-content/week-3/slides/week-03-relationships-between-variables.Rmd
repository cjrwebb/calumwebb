## Learning Objectives

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[What will I learn?]

By the end of this week you will:

* Learn how to __use variable types to select appropriate bivariate data visualisations and descriptive statistics__.

* Be able to create and interpret __bivariate bar charts, heatmaps, boxplots, ridgeplots, scatterplots, and hexbin plots__ using `R`.

* Be able to calculate and interpret several __bivariate descriptive statistics including__ __contingency tables, Cramer's V, Mean/Median differences, Spearman's $\rho$, and Pearson's R__ in `R`.


]

.panel[.panel-name[How does this week fit into my course?]

* Bivariate statistics an be important parts of research studies themselves, especially research studies with *a priori* controls (e.g. randomised controlled trials).

* Bivariate statistics and data visualisations are important for checking assumptions and for communicating findings in research. 

* Bivariate statistics can also be used to develop the rationale behind case studies in mixed methods research.


]


]



???

* Grid of variable types and relevant visualisations and descriptive statistics (no tests yet)

__As the rank of immigration attitudes increases__ (people feel more that it should immigration should be increased and less that it should be reduced), __the rank of attitudes towards benefits tends to decrease__ (people feel more that benefits are too low rather than too high).

People who are pro-immigration are also more likely to support greater welfare generosity, though this is only a weak association.

* Can easily end up with overplotting - especially with discrete variables.

Possible solutions:

* Add jitter to points (artificially spread them out from their true value) - not great as it manipulates data.
* Make points smaller - useful for overplotting with continuous variables but less useful for discrete
* Add transparency - same as above

Or...

Pearson's correlation coefficient R, is a measure of __how closely associated the variance in one variable is with the variance in another variable__, relative to the maximum possible covariance they could share.

* `0 ` = No correlation - changes in the value of one variable are not associated with changes in the other.
* `1` = Perfect positive correlation - as the value of one variable increases the other also increases.

__Rules of thumb__:

* ±0.01 - 0.19 = Very weak/Negligible correlation
* ±0.20 - 0.39 = Weak correlation
* ±0.40 - 0.59 = Moderate correlation
* ±0.60 - 0.79 = Strong correlation

# Summary

<br>

* There are a large range of ways to visualise and statistically describe relationships between variables in `R`; __appropriate methods can be chosen by considering the type of variables we wish to analyse using what we learned in Week 2.__ 

--

* __Visualisations of relationships__ between variables can help us get a full and proportionate picture of relationships, whereas __bivariate descriptive statistics__ (contingency tables, Spearman's Rho, Cramer's V, and Pearson's R) can give us a standardised, shorthand way of describing what these relationships are.
