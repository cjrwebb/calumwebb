## Learning Objectives

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[What will I learn?]

By the end of this week you will:

* Know where to find relevant information for participating in the module, including where to locate module resources and how to prepare for each week's class time.
* Be able to differentiate between quantitative social research approaches and qualitative research approaches and the way they shape our view of the social/human world.
* Be able to describe some of the reasons why quantitative research can be useful, while being cautious around the pitfalls of its methods and methodology.
* Have installed `R` and Rstudio and be able to interact with the console, run scripts, check help documentation, distinguish between environmental object types, and read in data.

]

.panel[.panel-name[How does this week fit into my course?]

* Help you schedule your independent learning for the rest of the module to fit within the demands of the programme.
* Give you an indication of when quantitative research projects (or components of projects) may be useful, and see how the content of SMI606 fits together with SMI607 Principles of Social Research I and Principles of Research Design II.
* Introduce you to `R`, a flexible open-source statistical programming language that can be used for quantitative data analysis but also for presenting, reporting, and other purposes.

]



]



???

* Introduce you to the module and instructors, structure and timetable, resources and support available, contingencies for COVID and remote support
* Introduce the concept of quantitative social science and the assumptions it makes about the human world: why do we use it? What do we assume when we use it? How do we make sense of it? These will be explored more in SMI607 Principles of Social Research I
* Introduce `R`, install `R`, and talk about the layout of Rstudio, different kinds of variables in the R environment, and how to read in and manipulate data (basic filtering, subsetting).

## Module design, timetable, and support

* Introductions to important statistical principles and methods in quantitative social science.
  * Intuition *over* equations.

--

* 'Hands-on' experience putting these principles into practice in `R` using real-world data. 

--

* Assessment on two small quantitative research projects where the topic is decided by you.

## Module design, timetable, and support

__Time__: 9:00-10:50 Wednesdays (Week 1-5, 7-11)  
__Location__: Hicks Building G25

__Consultation & Feedback Hours__: 15:00-16:00 Wednesdays (Week 1-12)  
*Can be booked online or face-to-face. See: [how to book](https://calumwebb.co.uk/teaching/appointments/).*

__Weekly Drop-in Sessions__: 16:00-17:00 Thursdays (Week 1-5, 7-12)  
*Virtual only initially. No booking required. Meeting room:* [meet.google.com/qvo-cpkp-ndz](https://meet.google.com/qvo-cpkp-ndz)

## Responsibilities and expectations

As a rough guideline you __should expect to devote around 10 hours of study time per week to this module__ during a typical 15-week semester.

--

__It is up to you to identify your learning needs__ and use the resources provided to meet them. I am happy to help you with this process.

--

To ensure your independent learning is productive, you should __regularly think about what parts of the module are challenging you__. Examples of this might be:

* Reading and manipulating data in `R`.
* Interpreting the output of statistical tests.
* Creating graphs.

--

And lastly, remember to **ask for help if you need it!** There is no such thing as a stupid question.

Du Bois' analysis and interpretation of racism led to his summative pronouncement that __systemic inequality was associated with increasing health risks and high mortality rates__ .grey[... When he connected the systemic inequality of racism to education, criminal justice, poverty, and employment, Du Bois demonstrated the importance of a multidisciplinary collaborative lens of social epidemiological research. ... Du Bois' recommended interventions and strategies to confront the determinants of health and determinants of death in the 7th Ward would have been well posed for policy development aimed at combating racism and eliminating health disparities.]

* Can we ever be free of all bias and political motivation in our research, as historical Positivism promoted (__dispassionate social inquiry__)? 

* Would we even enjoy or want to do research if we were? __What would the point be?__

### .tuos_purple[Methodological Objectivity]

* What we *can* do is ensure the methods we use, our data, and the steps we went through are __transparent, replicable, and well-communicated__.
<br><br>

* What do we lose by accepting and making our values explicit but retaining our methodological objectivity? What do we gain? (e.g. see: Indigenous Methodologies in Walter, 2006 and Andersen & Walter, 2013).
