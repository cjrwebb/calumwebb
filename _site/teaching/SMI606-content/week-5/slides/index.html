## Learning Objectives

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[What will I learn?]

By the end of this week you will:

* Be able to describe what we mean by causality and how we can use statistical methods to explore probabilistic causation.

* Be able to explain two bases upon which causal inference can be made: robust dependence and consequential manipulation.

* Be able to critically assess these foundations of causal inference.

* Be able to identify which types of research design and data are appropriate for making causal inference. 


]

.panel[.panel-name[How does this week fit into my course?]

* It is increasingly important for new social scientists to have a good working knowledge of causality and causal analysis.

* Being able to synthesize different forms of research into generative processes (e.g. DAGs) is increasingly a goal of postgraduate and postdoctoral research projects.

* This week's content will provide some of the fundamental building blocks for more advanced methods (e.g. Structural Equation Modelling, Longitudinal Modelling, A-B testing) you may need to learn in your career or may wish to cover in the rest of your studies.

# 'Causality'

Using the work and definitions developed by sociologist John H. Goldthorpe (2001).


.pull-left[

### Deterministic Causality

* In philosophy and theology, the idea of causality as a deterministic force: Given enough information about past events, every outcome can, in theory, be explained or predicted.

[Hoefer, 2003. *Causal Determinism*. Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/)

]

.pull-right[

### Probabilistic Causality

* Causes raise the probability of their effects, some of which may be screened off or superseded by other causal relations. &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;

[*Hitchcock, 2018. Probabilistic Causation. Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy*](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-probabilistic/)

### [S]uppose that Billy and Suzy each throw a rock at a bottle, and that each has a certain probability of hitting and breaking it. As it happens, __Suzy’s rock hits the bottle, and Billy’s doesn’t. As things actually happened, we would say that Suzy’s throw caused the bottle to shatter, while Billy’s didn’t__. Nonetheless, Billy’s throw increased the probability that the bottle would shatter ... Billy’s throw had a tendency to shatter the bottle; it was a potential cause of the bottle shattering; it was the sort of thing that generally causes shattering; but it did not actually cause the bottle to shatter.

# Causation as Robust Dependence

Causality can be argued to exist when we can observe a consistent, temporal causal effect.

&gt; #### "A variable, X, 'Granger causes' Y if, after taking into account all information apart from values of X, these values still add to one's ability to predict future values of Y."

.right[Goldthorpe, 2001: 2]

--

* Does knowing the value of X at a preceding time point improve our accuracy when predicting Y, after accounting for other competing explanations?

--

* Measurements of X and controls (Z) **must** preceed measurements of Y.

--

* Can be __deepened through 'Lazarfeldian elaboraton'__
  * Identify a 'signal' and 'response'
  * Iteratively introduce possible confounding factors and see if the pattern between 'signal' and 'response' stays the same (or continues to exist)

# Causation as Robust Dependence

__Weaknesses__

* **Easy for this approach to end up being atheoretical**, with causality claimed purely on the basis of statistical models.
  * "[S]ociologists have strongly criticized the supposition that statistical techniques can in them- selves provide adequate causal explanations of social phenomena"
  
--

* Is it possible to __fully incorporate all of the possible confounding variables__, or to adequately measure some causes.
  * "[A]vailable sociological theory may just not be strong enough to help produce models that can be treated as genuinely 'structural' — i.e. so parameterized that their co- e¤cients are su¤ciently invariant and autonomous to sustain claims about the consequences of changes in the variables deemed to be 'exogenous'."

# Causation as Consequential Manipulation

Causation as some environmental factor that, when manipulated (or left alone), can be demonstrated to cause some change in an outcome variable of interest.

&gt; #### "Here, attention centres specifically on 'the consequences of performing particular acts' or, in other words, on establishing causation through experimental methods."

.right[Goldthorpe, 2001: 4]

* If I manipulate this thing, does the result change (probabilistically thinking)? If so, the thing I manipulated can be said to have caused a change in something else.

--

* Something __must__ be manipulated or manipulatable, and exposure to the change or difference must be either randomly chosen *or* be unrelated to the variables of interest (as in a random experiment).

---

# Causation as Consequential Manipulation

__Exercise__

.pull-left[

&lt;br&gt;

At the beginning of this session, chocolate buttons were randomly allocated behind the computer lab computers.

If you got chocolate buttons, you are the treatment group. If you did not get chocolate buttons, you are the control group (sorry, remote learners!).

* H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;: Being given chocolate buttons will have no effect on students' enjoyment of learning quantitative methods.

# Causation as Generative Process


.pull-left[

* __Start with a theoretical model__ of a generative causal process based on a variety of evidence (qual + quants).

* __Develop the processes in this model__, ideally down to the 'methodological individual' — individual actions, characteristics, and events (if appropriate).

* Design hypotheses and research studies to __test the causal associations between each of the processes__. Some may be "stronger" causal evidence, others may be weaker by necessity.

* Aim for __falsification__ of the processes and __adaptation__ of the theoretical model, not "once-and-for-all" __validation__.

#### __Natural Experiment__

A naturally occuring scenario where people are randomised into a suitable treatment or control group by circumstances outside of the researcher's control, and as such, can be compared to assess causal effects by consequential manipulation. Data can come from administrative records, surveys, or both.

* Usually a small sample, not often representative.
* An organic scenario that __allows for causal inference based on__ __consequential manipulation__.

  
Example:

* [The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment](https://www.nber.org/programs-projects/projects-and-centers/oregon-health-insurance-experiment?page=1&amp;perPage=50)

.small["[i]n early 2008, Oregon opened a waiting list for its Medicaid program for low-income adults that had previously been closed to new enrollment. Approximately 90,000 people signed up for the available 10,000 openings. The state drew names from this waiting list by lottery to fill the openings."]

#### __Administrative Data__

Data that is primarily collected for an administrative purpose which can be re-purposed for social science research. Commonly comes from government departments, schools, and welfare, tax, or healthcare administration.

* Often an enormous sample, usually the majority of the population and often close to 100%.
* Often collected over a person's lifespan and updated, therefore __allowing for causal inference by robust dependence__ (or by consequent manipulation in the case of natural experiments, e.g. Universal Credit rollout).

#### __Scraped Data__

Data that is largely unstructured but publicly available on the internet or in some other form (like a pdf). This data is then 'scraped' and sorted into a dataset using its underlying web structure (e.g. its HTML code).

* Sometimes not much of a meaningful sample, e.g. unlikely to be a good sample of people, might be a good sample of interactions on a platform (e.g. Tweets on Twitter) if selected randomly.
* Often longitudinal in nature but sometimes temporality is lost if not scraped repeatedly (e.g. prices of items on Amazon, tweets that get deleted)
* __Some potential for causal inference by robust dependence or consequent manipulation.__

* [Scraping Twitter data in R](https://utstat.toronto.edu/~nathan/teaching/sta4002/Class1/scrapingtwitterinR-NT.html)

.pull-right[

#### __Observational or Sensor Data__

Traditionally, observational data is collected by researchers watching and recording events that happen. Increasingly, collected by sensors (e.g. geotracking of devices, wearable medical devices).

* Not frequently used in university social science, but much data like this is held by large corporations (e.g. Google, Apple, Fitbit, Garmin).
* Often has a temporal component, so __can feasibly be used for establishing robust dependence__. Could form the basis for a natural experiment. __Researcher can manipulate environment__ in some way and then try and observe cause through __consequential manipulation__, but is this ethical?

  
Example:

* [Weekly People-Movement GPS Patterns in Spain during the pandemic](https://data.world/citydataai/spain-regions)
* [Pokemon Go](https://kotaku.com/the-creators-of-pokemon-go-mapped-the-world-now-theyre-1838974714) / Strava / Garmin / Fitbit

# Summary

* __Causality__ has been conceptualised in different ways and the way that it is established in quantitative research is often through either "__robust dependence__" or "__consequential manipulation__".

* Critics of these approaches have highlighted that they __risk__ __researchers taking an__ **atheoretical stance** and relying too heavily on statistics to determine causality.

* Any causal claims should also be __based on theory derived from a range of sources__.

* Viewing __causality as a generative process__ can be more conducive to understanding the __complexity__ in social science.

* A __falsificationist__ approach to establishing causal processes, mechanisms, and patterns, is generally preferable to having to wait for a __'once-and-for-all'__ study that verifies a given causal relationship.

* The kinds of causal analysis that can be done __depends on the data that is available, the research design, and the method that was used to collect it.__

# R Exercise

* This week, you will be practicing running the inferential statistics tests we covered last week using data from a **mixture** of studies (some where causation can be established, some where it cannot).

* Download the `week-5-exercise.zip` file on the Blackboard page and open the Rproject file. Open the `week-5-exercise.Rmd`.

* Go through the exercises. There is a challenge at the end with some open data experiments!
