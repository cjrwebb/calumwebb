### Activity 1: What is poverty?

Please open the [Google Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1H67WE1fPAJ89-a3zJA8PRVW1a34JbQAtabJgKejmwJw/edit?usp=sharing) to contribute. To help break down the question I have divided the jamboard into three subsections:

* What kind of experiences do people have in poverty?
* How would someone measure poverty?
* What does it mean to not live in poverty?

---

### Subsisting or Participating?

.pull-left[

__Subsistence-based definition of poverty__

* Does a person have sufficient income to afford a diet that meets a minimum set of nutritional requirements?

* Does a person have sufficient income to afford adequate shelter that protects from environmental hazards (warmth, safety)?

* Does a person have sufficient income to afford essentials to protect them from hazards outside the home (clothing, shoes)?

* (Sometimes) does a person have sufficient income to afford essential healthcare, medicine, and preventative healthcare items?

* In the UK: Destitution (JRF), food poverty, fuel poverty, period poverty, homelessness.

__Participation-based definition of poverty__

&lt;br&gt;

&gt; “People are relatively deprived if they cannot obtain, at all, or sufficiently, the conditions of life – that is, the diets, amenities, standards and services which allow them to play the roles, participate in the relatonships and follow the customary behaviour which is expected of them by virtue of their membership of society. If they lack or are denied the incomes, or more exactly the resources... to obtain access to these conditions of life they can be defined to be in poverty.”

__Participation-based definition of poverty__

Material deprivation questionnaire example questions from EUROSTAT: Can you afford to do the following:

* Replace worn-out furniture?
* Replace worn-out clothes by some new (not second-hand) ones?
* Two pairs of properly fitting shoes (including a pair of all- weather shoes)?
* Get-together with friends/family (relatives) for a drink/meal at least once a month?
* Regularly participate in a leisure activity?
* Spend a small amount of money each week on yourself (e.g., to go to the movies, to the bar, to buy something for yourself, to have a meal outside)?
* Eat fruits and vegetables once a day?
* Arrange celebrations on special occasions?
* Go on holiday away from home at least one week per year?

### Activity 2: Subsistence &amp; participation definitions

Please open the [Google Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1_rmDvwnSfSr7iujWCRu_I_VeCu1LnpkSEdWe00nSe-g/edit?usp=sharing) to contribute. 

This jamboard contains six "case studies". 

* In the first jamboard, the __subsistence__ definition of poverty is given and you are asked to __sort the case studies by whether they meet the definition of poverty or not below__.

* In the second jamboard, the __participation__ definition of poverty is given and you are asked to __sort the case studies by whether they meet the definition of poverty or not below__.

### Multidimensional Frameworks of Poverty

One weakness of this definition is that it works best when participation can be thought of as items that can be 'costed'; but this assumes or ignores:

--

* Participation that cannot be costed without a lot of disagreement (e.g. what is the 'cost' of caring for relative, or the cost of having a normal family life)

--

* What about emotional or socio-relational participation (dignity, feeling like a 'useful' member of society, shame, powerlessness, voice, diminished citizenship, inability to enforce rights)

--

* What about the community, local, and national resources needed for participation in society? (Even if you could afford to take part in leisure, what if your community hasn't been deemed 'worthy' of having access to a leisure centre? Can you meaningfully participate in art, culture, history, education and what is the cost of this to the individual?)

--

* What about the fact that participation requires more resources for some people than others? (e.g. if you have an impairment, you require more resources to not be disabled by society)

Please open the [Google Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1dJl13mIbFHBr2lrhlRcQdTidrfA0_bYq0cWaKMx5fRM/edit?usp=sharing) to contribute. 

* Each of the multidimensional theory summary diagrams is on a jamboard; think about some experiences you or people you have met have had and whether they can be placed in the diagram.

* Which do you find easiest to work with? What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of this level of detail?

# Reflections

--

* While extra attention on food, clothing, fuel, etc. poverty is important, it __risks regressing our definition of poverty__ and ignoring rights and justice (fairness). 

&gt; "There's no such thing as real poverty in 21st century Britain." Lord Alan Sugar

--

* Is there such a thing as __too much complexity?__ How do we convince policymakers, resource officers, etc. that some of these things are poverty? Where do we draw a line (and do we draw a line at all?) 

--

* Where do concepts like multidimensional poverty end and concepts like the social model of disability or capabilities or quality of life begin?

--

* Rather than thinking of passive exposure to poverty, are these concepts more helpful when we think about how poverty and dependency are socially created (Walker, 2009)? 

  * Poverty and dependency is regularly socially created for many older people, and disabled people, through a narrow vision of what work and labour means; what care means and how it is valued; the opportunities given to participate; and a focus on the dependent/provider dynamic over an interdependence dynamic.

* __What are your reflections?__
