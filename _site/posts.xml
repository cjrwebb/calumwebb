      <title>Socioeconomic inequalities in child welfare interventions are five times stronger in unequal and affluent local authorities than they are in equal and deprived local authorities. Why?</title>

      <description>One of the articles we had published in Children and Youth Services Review this year highlighted a new finding that the social gradient in child welfare interventions was predicted to be as much as five times stronger in local authorities with both lower-than-average deprivation and higher-than-average income inequality than it was in local authorities with higher-than-average deprivation and lower-than-average income inequality. This blog post explores one reason why this might be.</description>

      <description>The programming equivalent of a hair's breadth stands between the code required to analyse trends, associations, and inequalities in data and the code required to turn these into contextless, essentialist predictions.</description>

      <title>Anti-racist and anti-poverty social work must be both: Child Welfare Inequalities at the intersection of race and class</title>

      <description>Our new research published in Children and Youth Services Review shows how the social gradient varies based on ethnic population, and what sociological theories and policy analysis might explain why this happens. This blog discusses some of the key messages for social work.</description>

      <title>Policy and Practice or Structural Inequality? Challenging the popular interpretation of the NAO's 2019 report on pressures on children's social care.</title>
      <dc:creator>Calum Webb</dc:creator>
      <link>https:://calumwebb.co.uk/posts/2020-04-26-policy-and-practice</link>
      <description>A common myth that seems to stem from interpretations of the NAO's analysis of children's social care is that most differences between local authorities are down to local policy and practice, and that structural disadvantage explains comparatively little. Our research challenges this interpretation.</description>

      <title>The biggest problem with the funding formula for Children's Social Services isn't that it's too inequitable, it's that it's too relative.</title>

      <link>https:://calumwebb.co.uk/posts/2020-04-25-the-biggest-problem-with-the-funding-formula</link>
      <description>It is a mathematical fact that the larger the gap between the resources needed and the resources provided is, the more inequitable a relative funding formula becomes, regardless of how accurate its proportioning is.</description>
