    "contents": "\n\n“In any case, we have found no significant correlation between levels of deprivation and the performance of children’s services. Nor can it be put down to funding levels – some of the authorities judged inadequate are among the highest spenders.”\n\nSir Michael Wilshaw’s speech on the launch of Ofsted’s Social Care Annual Report 2016\nIn 2017, Paul Bywaters, Tim Sparks, and I challenged this statement from Ofsted in an article written for Community Care. This later led to some revision of the claim in a following Ofsted report, which acknowledged that there may be some association between levels of deprivation and children’s services Ofsted outcomes. Later, research by David Wilkins and Vivi Antonopoulou reported an association between levels of deprivation and Ofsted outcomes, but found no association between local authority expenditure and Ofsted outcomes (see: Wilkins and Antonopoulou, 2020a, and Wilkins and Antonopoulou, 2020b).\nThis week, a new paper authored by Davara Bennett (University of Liverpool), Paul Bywaters (Huddersfield University), and me was published in Social Policy and Society. We found that levels of deprivation and levels of expenditure on early help and family support services were significant predictors of a positive (Good or Outstanding) Ofsted judgement.\nMore money, better odds\nEvery £100 per child increase in early help and family support-related spending was associated with around a 1.7 times increase in the odds of receiving a Good or Outstanding Ofsted rating, after controlling for deprivation, the year of the inspection, and levels of safeguarding expenditure. To put this number in context, over the 2010 decade the highest level of expenditure per child on these services was around £1,000 and the lowest was around £90 per child, with the average local authority spending somewhere between £220 and £380 per child, indicating that multiple increments of increase of this value would not be unrealistic.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Association between positive Ofsted outcomes and spending on early help/family support.\n\n\n\nHowever, we found no association between ‘safeguarding’ expenditure (that is, expenditure largely associated with the social work workforce and child protection functions) and Ofsted outcomes. We suspect this along with some methodological differences may explain why previous analyses by the National Audit Office, and by Wilkins and Antonopoulou, may have found no association between expenditure and Ofsted outcomes.\nWe believe that this evidence suggests that greater capacity to invest in early help and family support — capacity that has declined rapidly and inequitably over the 2010 decade — may help reduce failure demand in children’s services; meaning increases in demand that are associated with a failure to do something, or to do something right (Seddon and Brand, 2008). Rick Hood (2015) describes the impact of failure demand on children’s services as leading to a state where:\n\n“[I]ssues that are not resolved straightaway keep reappearing and cumulatively start to overload the system’s ability to cope”\n\nThe figure below shows how Ofsted judgements of local authorities have been distributed across three tertiles of expenditure on early help and family support between 2012-13 (after Ofsted replaced ‘adequate’ with ‘required improvement to be good’) and 2019-2020, after adjusting for deprivation. The third of local authorities with the highest deprivation-adjusted expenditure on early help and family support have been notably more likely to receive Good or Outstanding Ofsted outcomes than those with relatively middling or low expenditure per child on these services.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A Sankey diagram showing the distribution of Ofsted outcomes between 2012 and 2020, broken down by adjusted Early Help/Family Support spending tertile.\n\n\n\nPoverty and Ofsted ratings\nJust as Wilkins and Antonoloupou found, we also found that there was a strong association between levels of poverty (in this case, Indices of Multiple Deprivation decile) and the likelihood of a local authority receiving a positive Ofsted rating. The more deprived a local authority was, the less likely they were to receive a Good or Outstanding judgement. For every increase in IMD score decile — meaning moving from, say, the least deprived 10% of local authorities to between the 10th and 20th percentiles of local authorities) — there was around a 16 per cent decrease in the odds of receiving a Good or Outstanding Ofsted rating on inspection, after controlling for expenditure and year.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Association between positive Ofsted outcomes and poverty.\n\n\n\nThis means that, controlling for average levels of expenditure and the propensity for different distributions of outcomes across the decade, we predict that a local authority in the least deprived decile of local authorities in England would have a around 53 per cent chance of receiving a Good or Outstanding outcome while a local authority in the most deprived 10 per cent of all local authorities in England would only have around a 19 per cent chance of a ‘Good’ or ‘Outstanding’ outcome.\nThe Sankey plot below also seems to suggest that this inequality in Ofsted outcomes has gotten worse over time. In 2012, around 60% of the most deprived third of local authorities in England held ‘Requires Improvement to be Good’ or ‘Inadequate’ Ofsted ratings, compared to 66% of the least deprived third. By contrast, in 2020 around 68% of the most deprived third of local authorities held ratings below ‘Good’ while in the least deprived third of local authorities this figure had fallen to 48%.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: A Sankey diagram showing the distribution of Ofsted outcomes between 2012 and 2020, broken down by deprivation tertile.\n\n\n\nThe political and health consequences of context\nIf we take for granted that Ofsted judgements are an accurate representation of the quality of children’s services (which others have rightly argued may not be the case) these findings clearly suggest that those children most in need of good-quality services are the least likely to have access to them. This has parallels to Julian Tudor Hart’s well known ‘inverse care law’, that the ‘availability of good medical care tends to vary inversely with the need for it in the population served’. Without proper attention to the role that socioeconomic and funding contexts play in children’s services quality, or the ratings of such, social inequalities are likely to become further entrenched and the adversities children and families face are less likely to be met with remedial support.\nPolitically, these findings raise important questions about the role of ‘take over’ policies. These reforms introduced in 2015 were described by a government spokesperson as: “a formalised academy-style system … any local authority judged as inadequate by Ofsted has to show significant improvement within six months or be taken over”. To date, nine local authority children’s services (covering around 8% of the child population) have been removed from public ownership and replaced with independent trusts, with a tenth conversion on the horizon. A disproportionate number of these local authorities — Doncaster, Sunderland, Sandwell, and Birmingham — are in the most deprived 20 per cent of all local authorities. A further four all reported severe funding pressures prior to their conversion.\nIf ‘take over’ policies are a consequence of local levels of poverty and funding, both of which are determined by national policies and decision-making, this risks creating two tiers of children’s services — one which is publicly owned and publicly accountable, for those better funded and more affluent areas, and one which is opened up to marketisation through ‘take over’. Given the disproportionate spending of the Government’s ‘levelling up fund’ in already affluent local authorities, as well as the disproportionate impact of austerity measures in poorer areas, these political consequences look set to deepen.\nThe political issues associated with ‘take over’ policies and the health-related issues associated with the inverse care law are not altogether separate. Tudor Hart found that when medical care is more exposed to market forces the law operates more strongly, meaning that health inequalities increase. As such, a lack of attention to the socioeconomic predictors of Ofsted judgements, and the role that Ofsted judgements play in take over policies, creates, in theory, a system poised to exacerbate child welfare inequalities.\nThe views in this blog are not necessarily the views of my co-authors.

It builds upon a previous submission made by the authors in response to the Call for Evidence.1\nIntroduction\nThe Case for Change (CfC) offers an important opportunity to address fundamental questions about the kinds of systems and practices that have been developed over time under the rubric of child protection. It identifies some key tensions, most notably around protection and support, with a particular concern to explore the perception that the current system is too focused on investigations rather than help. It also highlights the very significant challenges faced by care-experienced children and young people.\nWhile there is much in the CfC that we find persuasive in its description of the impacts of contemporary practices and systems, we agree with those who have noted that an understanding of the present situation requires a clear analysis of the past and particularly of the policy choices that have led to the present and this is missing from the document.2\nIn this response, we offer an analysis of why help is so often not available to families currently and identify the importance of offering such help. We also offer an analysis of some of the challenges facing those children and young people who enter the care system and our concerns about the lack of discussion about the complexities of adoption in the CfC.\nWe start by highlighting why, if the Independent Review of Children’s Social Care (hereafter called the review) is to be truly transformative, it needs to engage much more fully with the lessons of Covid-19 than the CfC does.\nCovid-19: a game changer?\nIt is perhaps surprising that the CfC, with its promotion of a ‘once in a generation’ opportunity to engage in fundamental reform, pays so little attention to Covid-19 and the key messages that have emerged.\nMichael Marmot and colleagues in public health have been particularly influential in highlighting how the pandemic has exposed and intensified long standing inequalities in economic and social conditions and the contribution these have made to the high and unequal death toll from Covid-19.3\nIn February 2020, before the impacts of Covid-19 became evident, Marmot and his colleagues reported on health inequalities with the finding that, over the previous decade, life expectancy had fallen for some groups:\n\nEngland experienced continuous improvements in life expectancy but from 2011 these improvements slowed dramatically, almost grinding to a halt. For part of the decade 2010-2020 life expectancy actually fell in the most deprived communities outside London for women and in some regions for men. For men and women everywhere the time spent in poor health is increasing.4\n\nNot only had the social gradient in mortality and morbidity become steeper over the decade, but years spent in ill-health went up. A subsequent report in December 20203 provided detailed data on the way in which pre-existing socioeconomic inequalities worsened the impact of the virus and argued for the need to ‘build back fairer’ and tackle the ‘causes of the causes’:\nAge-standardised mortality rates were almost double in the most deprived areas for Covid-19 and for other causes.\nThose living in overcrowded housing, working in low-paid insecure work such as in public transport, leisure, hospitality, care work or service industries and their children had been disproportionately affected. They were also more likely to be from an ethnic minority background.\nThe concept of the social gradient, the term used to describe the phenomenon whereby people who are less advantaged socio-economically have worse health than those who are more advantaged, has become much more accepted beyond public health as a result of the pandemic. Researchers have highlighted its relevance to mental health difficulties5 and very recently to domestic abuse.6\nIn the context of successive lockdowns and restrictions, housing issues achieved renewed significance. The disparities in living conditions became starkly apparent amid evidence of a crisis in sufficiency, quality and affordability that has been 30 years in the making. The impacts of poor housing conditions upon children’s safety, physical and mental health are considerable and becoming more fully recognised by those involved in research, policy and practice.7\nWhile children and young people have not been as vulnerable to illness and death, they have been disproportionately, and unequally, harmed by the impacts of restrictions and lockdown.8 The closure of early years services, schools and youth facilities and disruption to universities, further education and apprenticeships have led to widening inequalities in children and young people’s development and education and in post-18 training and employment. This group is also experiencing rapid increases in unemployment and there has been a rise in mental health difficulties from a level that was already concerning.9\nOverall, the pandemic has highlighted the dynamic and shifting contours of deprivation and its impact on an array of social problems. It emphasises the importance of engaging with the reality that demand in areas such as Children’s Social Care will fluctuate in line with socio-economic changes and the wider policy choices that affect these, for better or ill. \nThe pandemic has also taught us a lot about what can be achieved when national and local government work together as well as the strengths to be found in communities. Mutual aid activities have been a feature of disasters historically10 and this pandemic has proved no exception.11 Already existing developments around The Community Paradigm and the work of Hilary Cottam on Radical Help have been the subject of a renewed focus of attention and highlighted lessons for Children’s Social Care, as well as more widely, about the importance of working in, and with communities, post-pandemic.12,13\nIn Children’s Social Care, there is growing interest in moving beyond reliance on top-down professional-led approaches to protecting children to those that that promote community and locality-based services, co-production and peer support. It is vital to locate these developments within the lessons we have learned, however, about the importance of a robust framework of rights and entitlements guaranteed by the local and national state.\nChildren’s Social Care is a key part of the collective endeavour that will be needed to ‘build back fairer.’ If it is to play its part well, it will need to be integrated with wider social efforts to tackle poverty and inequality so that we can tackle current challenges as well as prevent future difficulties.9 We would, therefore, urge the review to engage with contemporary debates and developments around ‘building back fairer’ and the implications.\nWhy do families not get the help they need currently?\nWe share the concerns outlined in the CfC in relation to the lack of timely accessible non- stigmatising help for families experiencing a range of difficulties. However, the analysis in the CfC remains at the level of the descriptive promoting the dangerous illusion that all that is required is for social workers and local authorities to change their practices and simply reorient what they are doing. Understanding why the current system is not helping families in the way we would want requires an understanding of the political, economic, and social forces that have orchestrated the decline in availability and effectiveness of preventative and family support services14,15,16. It also means a hard-headed look at the roles played by successive governments and wider cultural forces in fostering risk averse practices.\nOn the supply side, it is becoming clearer and clearer that the austerity policies of Conservative-led governments, over the last decade, cannot be disassociated from their consequences for children’s services. The review ignores the vast majority of cuts made to local authority children’s and young peoples’ services by the Conservative-led coalition government in the years immediately preceding the starting point of their analysis at its peril; analysing spending changes from a baseline of 2012-13 rather than 2010-11, for example, obscures just over 75 per cent of reductions in spending per child over the decade.17,19 The Local Government Association reported that local authorities have lost more than 60 per cent of the central government funding they received in 2010/11, which equates to nearly £16 billion.20 The average expenditure per child on children and young people’s services has fallen by 14.8 per cent between 2010/11 and 2018/19, and expenditure on family support services, services for young people, children’s centres, and other activities not directly related to children looked-after services or child protection safeguarding has fallen on average by 52.6 per cent.17 These spending reductions have been up to 1.5 times larger in the most deprived third of local authorities due to the regressive changes to the funding formula made in 2012 and the inequitable impact of central government core grant funding reductions due to more affluent local authorities’ greater capacity to raise revenue through local taxes and business rates.19,21 It is estimated that over 750 youth centres and 1,000 registered children’s centres have been closed between 2010 and 2019, and 2009 and 2017, respectively.22,23\nThe scale of investment needed to not only pull services back from the brink that ten years of austerity has pushed them towards, but to meet the rights and entitlements of children and families in England under the UNCRC and the Children Act 1989, is not acknowledged in the CfC. Equally, the Department for Education and Secretary of State for Education’s response to the Case for Change is extremely concerning. They promote a proposed £14 million investment in ‘Family Hubs,’ and the £24 million regional recovery fund for children’s social care, as proactive progress towards investment in children’s services seemingly oblivious to the inadequacy of this sum, which, even when combined, amounts to £250,000 per local authority, less than £2.70 per child in England. By our estimates, this is less than 1.1 per cent of the average amount of funding cut from local authorities’ early help and family support spending alone over the past ten years. At this rate of re-investment, even if it were provided every year from this point onwards, it would take more than 55 years to see similar levels of spending in our children’s services as those last seen in 2010-11, and that is assuming the costs of services remain the same, no further cuts to central government funding are made, and the additional support made available each year is increased with inflation. As such, it is clearly an inadequate response to the issues raised by the CfC that the review should challenge.\nWhile the amount proffered by the Department for Education is grossly inadequate, we believe the direction of movement towards reinvestment in family support and early help that the CfC supports is right, so long as doing so does not erode children’s rights, exacerbate existing inequities in availability of support across the country, remove or diminish accountability and oversight, or otherwise fundamentally oppose the aspirations of the Children Act 1989 that sees support and protection as a continuum (discussed below) . Research suggests that investing in local authority family support and early help services may reverse unsustainable cycles of escalation into care that can stem from lack of available help when families face initial hardship.16,15,24\nCausal statistical modelling has found that:\nOver the past decade, each £100 increase in spending per child was associated with a reduction of between 12 and 13 children ‘in need’ per 10,000 the following year, around a 4 per cent reduction in an average local authority. Average reductions in local authority spending equate to an estimated additional 13,000 to 16,500 children in need nationally for each year of the decade than there would be if spending had been retained at 2010-11 levels.\nThe effectiveness of family support and early help spending has been declining over the decade as services restrict their offerings and move to more targeted, less universal, forms of support as a result of underfunding and rationing.\nEach additional £100 per child spent on preventative services for adolescents in a given year was associated with an average decrease of 1.9 per 10,000 in 16-17 year olds entering care the following year (a 3.6 to 7.3 per cent reduction depending on the year). Cuts to this expenditure can account for a significant proportion of entries into care in this age group, which have doubled since 2012.\nThe quality of Children’s Social Care Services, judged by Ofsted, is related to expenditure on preventative services. After controlling for deprivation, each £100 per child increase in preventative services expenditure was associated with a 1.7 times increase in the odds of a local authority being judged to be ‘Good’ or ‘Outstanding’ by Ofsted.\nThe alternative to investing in family support is to try and manage demand for services through existing and/or additional thresholds. Our analysis of feedback loops in the children’s social care system shows this to be counterproductive:\nLocal authorities that ration their services more strictly end up with more ‘failure demand,’ i.e. re-referrals within 12 months.25\nFamily support services have adjusted to rising complexity of need by becoming more targeted, further reducing their ability to operate preventatively and reinforcing the negative feedback loop.25\nThe overall result is escalating demand for expensive late intervention, leading to higher costs in the medium to long term.\nOn the demand side, government policies have increased relative child poverty, the depth of poverty experienced by families, and the extent of destitution in the country. The numbers of children living in families in destitution increased by 76% from 2015 so that, in 2019, 550,000 children had experienced destitution.26\nOverall, we accept that the CfC makes important statements about the significance of poverty as a central driver of demand for children’s social care and as a major cause of adversity in children’s lives. It rightly points to parallels with inequalities in children’s education and the positive actions successive governments have taken to level educational outcomes. We also agree that this is an issue for local government as well as central government to grapple with. But this is clearly an issue which local government alone cannot solve, and the argument about the significance of poverty in family life needs to be extended to demonstrate the connections between family poverty and a range of current policies covering employment, welfare, housing, health and criminal justice as well as education. The argument needs to recognise the intricate relationships between poverty and other key drivers of suffering in families, including domestic violence, substance use and mental ill-health. And it is important to incorporate understanding of the shame and stigma that families in poverty often feel and how that can be exacerbated by hostile attitudes in public debate and in print and social media.\nHow have we got here?\nAlongside a sober look at the current financial issues must also come a clear-eyed engagement with the past when trying to understand why, running alongside the lack of support for families, increasingly scarce resources continue to be devoted to investigations under Section 47, many of which appear to be episodic in nature. This is discussed in CfC almost as if it were a new issue, and one of poor decision-making in social work, ‘rather than being possibly the oldest systemic issue in the history of children’s social care.’2 As Evans notes, the aspirations of the Children Act 1989 have never been realised in practice. Such aspirations were summarised by a key architect of the Act, Rupert Hughes:\n\nThis [Act] was designed to remind authorities that there is no sharp line between need and risk or between support and protection and that the services needed to be seen more as a continuum with a balanced provision targeted at the various degrees of need.\n\nThe financing of such aspirations was then, and continues to be, the elephant in the room.2 The Children Act was implemented without extra resources and at a time of growing demand in relation to child poverty.27 In practice, to manage the resource issues, sharp and often deeply divisive distinctions were drawn between protection and support, need and risk, distinctions which persist and are reproduced in CfC. These are deeply unhelpful and fly in the face of the evidence of the social gradient which highlights the fluid and shifting nature of needs and risks.\nSupport has consistently played second fiddle to protection in a risk averse climate and, indeed, this is understandable in many ways. As Parton noted, as far back as 1996, in the context of the re-focusing debates, achieving a balanced set of activities required facing up to the very problematic implications of how successive child death tragedies had been discussed and dealt with by politicians and the media.27 This has not improved in subsequent decades.28 Indeed, there has been a failure to build respectful and thoughtful dialogue and cultural and political consensus around the needs of children, the responsibilities of their families, communities and local and national governments.14 Child deaths have, too often, proved a lightening-rod for the playing out of political divisions and the performance of moral outrage to secure short-term political advantage. Without careful and painstaking work on what is needed to protect children at all levels of society, work which requires courage, pendulum swings will continue and, indeed, are likely to jeopardise the aspirations of the review itself.\nThese courageous conversations must involve engaging with long standing attitudes towards those who are poor. The move away from the more universal provision of welfare services established in the post-war period towards increasingly targeted provision brought with it a renaissance of publicly accepted, or even encouraged, acrimonious sentiment towards those who happen to be, often transiently, on the recipient side of our social contract.29,30,31 This is characterised by narratives of ‘deservingness’ and ‘undeservingness’ and ‘scrounging’ and ‘striving’ and is reflected in the opposition of risk with need, or protection with support. It can be argued that these attitudes have existed since antiquity but had been ratcheted up as increasingly rationed provision of support and blame-laden political narratives stoked perceptions of undeserving groups: ‘benefits cheats’ or the ‘intergenerationally workless,’ with such framings particularly targeting lone and working-class mothers.32,33 Social work and children’s social care do not exist in a vacuum outside of these attitudes and the policies that take advantage of them. What austerity policies and their flawed evidence-base achieved at the onset of the 2010 decade was a wholesale legitimisation and encouragement of such attitudes, and a strengthening of their institutionalisation in many public services, particularly in our benefits system. Our research has found that social workers have been placed in the centre of this moral maze as they have faced a tsunami of unmet need and the hollowing out of support services.34\nFinally, we consider there is a curious silence on the possible contribution of Ofsted to the focus on investigations. In our previous submission we noted that it was much more difficult for deprived local authorities to receive ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’ than more affluent local authorities, and, moreover, that judgments of ‘inadequate’ commonly led to more Section 47 enquiries, child protection plans and ‘heavy end’ interventions.1\nRemoving burdens or reducing rights?\nAlongside the relative silence about Ofsted is a rather unclear and potentially dangerous narrative about removing burdens from social workers in order that they can work directly to help children and families. We agree that there has been a proliferation of audit and inspection regimes over the decades and, indeed, the review led by Eileen Munro spoke directly to the need to shift the focus of practice from meeting the requirements of audit towards direct work with children and families. The CfC notes this shift has not occurred but does not interrogate why those who commissioned the Munro Review, and continue to be in government a decade later, have not addressed its recommendations fully.\nThe CfC fails to promote discussion on the distinctions between unhelpful administrative requirements and vital safeguards that provide the kinds of robust challenge necessary in a democratic society when the state intervenes in family life. Indeed, it is extremely concerning that the document makes almost no reference to the role of law or international conventions on human rights and children’s rights. We support the calls by Article 39 and other organisations who have urged the review to adopt a framework based on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child as the basis for policy recommendations.35\nThe CfC mentions “too many professional observers” yet no detail is provided about what roles are being referred to nor is there any acknowledgement that many were developed in order to safeguard and promote children’s welfare and rights (for example the statutory role of the Independent Reviewing Officer). The recent report of the Independent Inquiry into historic sexual abuse of children in care in Lambeth36 is a salutary reminder of the need for robust measures to hear the voices of, and provide, safeguards for children in care.\nIt is recognised within the CfC that many young people aged 16 and 17 years old have complex needs and have experienced serious harms. It expresses support for the government’s plan to regulate semi-independent accommodation for them through a new set of national standards but fails to argue for them to receive care within such accommodation. It notes that a ban on semi-independent homes for young people aged 16 and 17 years old would be to the detriment of some young people. Alongside others35 we are not asking for a ban, but for high-quality semi-independent units to provide day-to-day care for these children in accordance with their needs and rights.\nWe share the concern expressed in CfC that children in residential care currently do not have an equivalent legal entitlement to ‘Staying Put’ as children in foster care but would urge the review to go further and recommend parity for children in residential care to be able to ‘stay put’ until at least the age of 21.\nMaking not breaking relationships\nFinally, we welcome the CfC’s acknowledgement that care must build not break relationships and that the loss of valued relationships is a feature of so many children’s care experience. However, the CfC fails to address the role of adoption in its current form when considering the severance of relationships for care experienced children. Most of the children adopted in England are adopted from care, and many have siblings in care or living with their birth families. The current model of adoption is most often closed, (with no direct contact with birth family), leading to the frequent loss of relationships with significant people, including siblings.37 The Adoption Enquiry38 concluded that the current model of adoption fails to adequately recognise multiple attachments and the complex identities of adopted children. We recommend a significant rethink of approaches to ‘contact’ and connection between adopted children and their families that do not sever relationships so starkly. There is rarely a ‘clean break’ or severance in real life; relationships endure in hearts and minds.\nRecommendations\nThe Independent Review of Children’s Social Care should call for:\nthe principle of proportionate universalism to underpin central government funding allocations to local government. Funding should be proportionate to the scale of the problem, but universal in reach: more funding should be given to areas of greater deprivation and to communities experiencing high levels of poverty and exclusion. The scale of funding provided should reflect what is needed to meet the ambitions of the Children Act 1989 ensuring local authorities are able to offer a continuum of diverse forms of high-quality support and protection for all children who may need it.\na framework of cross-departmental policies at national and local levels to address the major social problems which impact on children’s wellbeing and healthy development particularly in the light of the impact of Covid-19\nthe adoption of a framework based on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child to inform policy recommendations\nthe alignment of services with what children, young people and families need to flourish, not just what they need to survive and be protected from harm\nthe co-production of services with children, young people and families as part of the shift towards help\nthe need for high-quality semi-independent units to provide day-to-day care for 16-17 year olds in accordance with their needs and rights\nparity for children in residential care to be able to ‘stay put’ until the age of 21.\na more open model of adoption\n\n\n\n1.

I’ve seen this discussion pop up now and again in relation to the Independent Review of Children’s Social Care’s Case for Change, but also in internal and external reviews of academic journal articles.\nThe argument basically comes down to whether we can reasonably include spending data from before the 2012-13 fiscal year in analyses of how children’s services spending has changed, and how these changes have affected other factors like the numbers of children in need, or the rate of child protection plans, and so on. There are a couple of arguments for doing this, based on good reasons in theory, and an important contextual reason to not do this.\nWhy might we want to exclude data before 2012-13 from our analyses of children’s services spending?\nOn one side, you have those who argue that data from before 2012-13 should not be included in longitudinal analyses of local authority spending. There are two major reasons why you might want to do this that I am familiar with.\nThe first is convenience. The spending lines for children’s services (Table A1 in the Section 251 Returns) have been consistent since 2012-13, as has the underlying data format for the most recent years and, as such, one has the ability to quickly assess multiple years of data without having to wrangle with different data formats. This is particularly beneficial if you happen to need to do some analysis in haste.\nThe second, more important reason often given is that before 2012-13 different numbers of, and differently named, categories were used for grouping together types of local authority expenditure. This is true, and is the reason given by the Independent Review of Children’s Social Care for focusing on spending after 2012-13 in their Case for Change.1 For example, in 2010-11 one spending category was called “Sure Start Children’s Centres” but, since 2012-13, after a significant funding formula change, the closest matching category was called “Sure Start Children’s Centres and Early Years”.\nThere would clearly be a risk if we were to treat these categorisations of spending as the same over time. Increases in expenditure between 2010-11 and 2012-13, for example, might be the result of local authority accountants recategorising some spending to account for the overt inclusion of early years in the spending category.\nThere is some evidence that this is a valid concern. For example, the total expenditure recorded in the “Other children and families services” category in the 2011 to 2012 fiscal year drops from £401 million to £110 million in the next fiscal year, while the total expenditure recorded in the “Sure Start Children’s Centres/Sure Start Children’s Centres and Early Years” grows from £1.1 billion to almost £1.2 billion. How can we be sure that these changes aren’t just a result of changes in accounting practices? We can’t. So, in theory, it’s sensible to exclude the earlier 2010-11 and 2011-12 years to ensure a more valid comparison of how, say, children’s centres expenditure has changed over time… Right?\nSeparating spending categories in theory and practice.\nSadly, no. The boundaries between categories, especially those that encompass preventative and family support services, are so porous that there’s really no way of knowing whether spending on services is recorded consistently between local authorities or even within the same local authority over time, even if you exclude 2010-11 and 2011-12. Anecdotally, we know that they are not.\nTo take an example, Sheffield and Derby, which have very similar levels of deprivation, recorded dramatically different levels of expenditure per child for some of these categories in 2012-13. In Sheffield, the spend per child on ‘Sure Start Centres and Early Years’ was recorded as £115 per child but in Derby this figure was £63 per child. Meanwhile, spend on ‘Other children and families services’ was 3.25 times higher in Derby (£39.18 per child) than it was in Sheffield (£12.05 per child), and the spend on ‘Family Support Services’ per child was almost 25 per cent lower in Derby (£77.37 per child) than in Sheffield (£102.41).\nAre there real differences in policy and commissioning of services between Sheffield and Derby? Probably, yes. But depending on how we group these broad preventative and family support categories the difference between the two local authorities looks very different. If we compared them on just one category, for example, ‘Sure Start Children’s Centres and Early Years’, we’d find that Derby spends only 55 per cent of what Sheffield does. But if we were to include everything, including their vast difference in spending on ‘Other children and families services’, this changes to Derby spending 67 per cent of what Sheffield does. This 12 percentage point difference is not a trivial amount.\nEven if we want to leverage the benefits of having more comparable categories of spending by limiting our analysis to 2012-13 onward, this still leaves us with unreliable comparisons that will vary depending on the value judgements made by the analyst. This includes, for example, whether to include or exclude ‘Other children and families services’ as preventative, early help, and family support provision, for which 40 out of 152 local authorities in 2012-13 recorded no expenditure at all. Perhaps these local authorities merely categorised the same expenditure under another heading, whereas others felt it could not be classified in this way. Some categories, like Youth Justice, are even more difficult to allocate to a larger group.\nIt would be a great advantage for research if we were confidently able to precisely delineate spending between categories. We could, in theory, analyse whether some kinds of spending, for example, ‘family support’ as opposed to ‘services for young people’, are associated with better outcomes for some children and young people, e.g. teenagers. Sadly, this limitation of the data means we would not be able to be truly confident our results really showed this; at least some sensible grouping of expenditure is required regardless of whether we limit ourselves to data after 2012-13 or not.\nHow can we group expenditure categories to compare change over time?\nIn our 2018 article, Paul Bywaters and I argued that the safest way to include data from before 2012-13 in analyses of children’s services spending was to instead create three groups from the comparable meta-categories. These groupings of expenditure were: ‘safeguarding expenditure’; ‘children looked-after expenditure’; and ‘non-safeguarding, non-children looked after related expenditure’. Safeguarding expenditure includes everything under the ‘Safeguarding children and young people’s services’ heading and children looked-after expenditure includes everything under the ‘Children looked after’ heading.\nThese two headings very specifically and consistently point towards local authority children and families social work functions, commissioning and children’s services strategy, and local children’s safeguarding boards for ‘safeguarding expenditure’ and towards all costs associated with children looked-after for ‘children looked-after expenditure’. There is likely to be far less leakage between these two categories and everything else over time and between local authorities because of how closed their interpretation is.\nEverything else, on the other hand, is likely to leak between the remaining categories. What is considered a family support service in one local authority might be an ‘Other children and families service’ in another; what might have been a ‘service for young people’ at the start of the decade might be recast as something else by the end.\nThis grouping does not advantage the arguments of those pushing a specific agendas that the cuts have been larger or those arguing they have been smaller in any way. One could selectively pick only the category that happens to show the largest or smallest decrease over time if they wanted to do that.\nWe have actually found in more recent studies that this grouping is quite conservative when it comes to the scale of the cuts to public services, and have started to recommend its use as a sensitivity test if a study relies on a more precarious grouping of categories (for example, when trying to delineate between services for teenagers as opposed to services for very young children). What it does enable us to do is imperfectly bridge the differences in data between everything before 2012-13 and everything after 2012-13.\nCuriously, the footnotes of the Independent Review of Children’s Social Care’s Case for Change2 document imply that something almost identical to the above categorisation of expenditure was used to delineate between ‘statutory’ and ‘non-statutory’ spending.3 It is not clear why, then, they chose not to integrate spending from 2010-11 and 2011-2012 when this harmonised grouping makes it possible, and was deliberately used in past studies like ours for this explicit purpose.\nNothing to see here: Why shouldn’t we exclude 2010-11 and 2011-12 from our analyses of children’s services spending?\nAs Dr. Harriet Churchill documented in the Journal of Children’s Services far before we did in Local Government Studies in 2018, some of the largest cuts to children’s services came immediately after the 2008 recession and at the start of the Conservative-led coalition government. By sheer virtue of the magnitude of these cuts, and how little was left in the local authority central grant by 2013, we see a significant levelling off after this and, as you can see in the CWIP App, well into the future.\nOur original analysis showed the median expenditure per child against the three categories above between 2010-11 and 2014-15. If we ignore 2010-11 and 2011-12 momentarily, the paper would show that there was a £17 per child cut in all children’s services expenditure between 2012-13 and 2014-15 (around 2%),4 and a £46 per child cut in non-safeguarding, non-children looked-after expenditure (around 15%).\nBy contrast, if we changed our baseline to 2010-11, we would find that the decrease was £105 per child in all expenditure (around -11.35%) and £167 per child in non-safeguarding, non-children looked-after expenditure (a 38.3% reduction). In other words, comparing 2014-15 to a baseline of 2012-13 as opposed to 2010-11 masks cuts to services that are between 3.6 and 6.2 times larger in magnitude than those after 2012-13.\nLet’s update these figures with data from the CWIP App through to 2018-19.

1 shows us that using 2012-13 as a baseline rather than 2010-11 hides around £117 in cuts in children’s services per child from the preceding two fiscal years. This means our end figure in terms of £s-per-head is more than 4 times smaller than it would have been if the baseline had been 2010-11. Using 2012-13 as a baseline results in a much more modest 4 per cent decrease in expenditure per child than the 14.8 per cent decrease when comparing 2010-11 to 2018-19.\nFor non-safeguarding, non-children looked after services spending the pattern is repeated. The absolute cuts to these services would be more than doubled from £125 per child to £254 per child if 2010-11 were set as the baseline. Similarly, the already dire 35.3 per cent relative decrease in spending would be inflated further to a 52.6 per cent one.\nConclusion\nIntentionally or not, excluding the results of the actions of the Conservative-led coalition government in their first two years of power, as the Independent Review of Children’s Social Care has in their Case for Change, paints a far more rosy picture of local authority children’s services finances in the recent past. Even if there are legitimate reasons for these years to be excluded, which does not appear to be the case here, the distorting effect it has on the representation of the policy and funding landscape should at least be acknowledged.\nWhat we gain for excluding these years in terms of the comparability of spending categories is minimal and remains problematic when comparing local authorities or change over time. By contrast, what we lose from the picture is an enormous shock to local authority spending power in a very short time frame. The start of the decade saw swingeing cuts, the effects of which local authorities are still contending with. What follows 2013 often looks like mild bloodletting in comparison.\nWell done if you made it this far, you might enjoy this dramatisation I made of your average Twitter debate about local authority children’s services finances as a Phoenix Wright case. I created this using objection.lol.\n\n\n\n\nPage 18↩︎\nPage 9↩︎\nThough I strongly disagree with family support, Sure Start, and services for young people being called “Non-statutory”, as one interpretation of Section 17 of the Children Act 1989 is that these services are a legal duty of local authorities.↩︎\nI did erroneously write this as a £15 cut per child in a tweet, because I was looking at the 2011-12 column and not the 2012-13 one.↩︎\n",

    "contents": "\nI was recently in a (virtual) room presenting forthcoming research to a large group of people. I’m not able to disclose who they were, so I will just call them very important and powerful people™, to the extent that they, unlike me, could probably change things if they wanted to. I explained that the papers my colleagues and I have under review showed that the more money local authorities were able to spend on family support and early help services in a given year, the fewer children in need and 16-17 year olds entering care there were the following year. The research also showed that the more local authorities spent on these services, the more likely they were to get a ‘Good’ or ‘Outstanding’ Ofsted rating under any of the frameworks from the past ten years. (This research is still under review, but I hope to be able to share it with you soon.)\nThings seemed to be going well. There was a general acknowledgment in the room that family support services and early help interventions were well worth investing in. And then, very slowly, the focus of the conversation started to change.\n\n“Yes, we all agree that we need more early help and family support. But we have to make sure that we’re using the most effective services with the best quality evidence.”\n\nI could go on for the length of a book about the problematic aspects of the term “best quality evidence” or how “effectiveness” is measured, never mind the fact that all public spending is accused of being inefficient by default. But there is something more fundamentally wrong with the tendency of very important and powerful people™ to focus first on efficiency. This came to mind today after seeing this hilariously self-defeating motivational cartoon.\n\n\n\nSufficiency and efficiency\n\n\n\nDespite our obsession with efficiency and its cousin, value for money, these things can be a distraction when focused on in contexts where there are insufficient resources in the first place. In the (de)motivational cartoon, the little man with the ladders achieved his objective of looking over the wall even with his horrendously inefficient use of wall-scaling technology. His lack of efficiency was made up for by the sufficiency of the resources provided to him. I’ve taken the liberty of extending the possible combinations of resources and efficiency that this cartoon implies above.\nAs shown in the (de)motivational cartoon, sufficient resources can usually compensate for inefficiency (A). Of course, it would be great if we could always use our resources in the most efficient way possible (B). This means that we don’t need to allocate more resources than we absolutely need to to achieve our objectives — a nice added bonus in addition to achieving our objective.\nBut what if we don’t have enough resources in general? Despite a clear difference in efficiency, neither approach C nor D reaches the objective of scaling the wall. This adds additional complications in trying to assess efficiency when neither approach has sufficient resources.\nBy definition, an efficient approach is the one the reaches the same objective with the least amount of resources. B is clearly more efficient than A. They both reach the same binary objective (climbing the wall) with different amounts of resources (ladders).\nBut in the case of C and D, we can’t get a reading on which is more efficient because neither achieves the objective, at least not without shifting the goalposts. We could, for instance, measure how close each approach got to the objective, but this is rarely something that can be operationalised or recorded when we translate the metaphor to public services, nor would such a translation be particularly meaningful to the person concerned or the service.\nSufficiency of resource is often a pre-requisite to being able to achieve an objective and identify the efficiency of one approach over another. It is considered quite crude or naive to suggest that a system would work much better with an uplift of resources alone, even if what is being done is fundamentally unchanged (regardless of how efficient or inefficient it may be). For many things though, enough really can be enough. If our focus is on improving efficiency, we should also be mindful that we risk misdiagnosing a fault in the system as a fault in the approach when working in contexts of insufficient resources. The consequences of this misdiagnosis can be highly disruptive.\nDoing the right thing\n\n\n\nThere are exceptions to every rule and the most important one here is that sufficient resources can only reach an objective if they are being used correctly. Needless to say, if you throw more resources at doing the wrong thing you will only end up doing it more wrongly. This is something I first heard from Kathy Evans, who informs me she first heard it from Simon Caulkin who, in turn, credits it to systems theorist Russell Ackoff. Ackoff is credited in Caulkin’s article as saying:\n\n“When we make a mistake doing the wrong thing and correct it, we become wronger. When we make a mistake doing the right thing and correct it, we become righter. Therefore, it is better to do the right thing wrong than the wrong thing right.”\n\nIf you are using your ladders to dig holes you are, very clearly, doing something wrong. If you are very efficient at digging holes with ladders, you are only going to be working very quickly towards the wrong objective. And if you have a large amount of resources, you are going to be doing this a lot.\nWhat should we focus on when it comes to improving public services?\nBased on the above logic, we might list the order our priorities should be in as follows:\n1. Is what we’re doing right?\nAre we doing things that are moving us in the right direction, towards our objective? If not, it won’t matter how efficient we are or how sufficient our resources are, because they’ll just take us further away from our goal.\n2. Is it insufficiency of resources holding us back, or lack of efficiency?\nDo we actually have enough resources to translate us doing the right thing into a meaningful outcome? Even if we made what we are doing more efficient, would our resources be enough to translate that into real change?\n3. Can what we are doing be made more efficient?\nIf we’re doing the right thing, and we have enough resources for it to reach a meaningful objective, can we make it any more efficient?\nHow often, when you speak to very important and powerful people™, do you witness the focus shifting on to the third point with little interrogation of first and second? After ten years of austerity, which saw an average reduction of more than 50 per cent per child in spending on early help and family support, with a post-Brexit, post-Covid-19 recession looming in the distance, the question of sufficiency of resources has never been more important.\nThe Conservative-led government has been fond of trumpeting their £14million investment in Family Hubs as a response to the crisis in children’s social care, with little challenge on the sheer insufficiency of this amount, which equates to only around 0.5 per cent of the family support and early help funding the average local authority has seen cut from their budgets over the past decade. At this point it likely doesn’t matter so much how efficiently we prop our ladders up against the wall, insufficient resources mean there is little chance of public services surmounting the obstacles between them and their objectives. This, in turn, makes them ever more vulnerable to political attacks.\nWhen climbing the wall means keeping children safe, with their parents when possible, and ensuring they have the best quality of life, let’s make sure we can do that first; then we can worry about optimising the number of ladders we use.\n\n\n\n",

Sometimes this is measured at different levels so, for example and in our ‘Untangling Child Welfare Inequalities’ paper, we look at the social gradient in neighbourhood (approx 1500 people) intervention rates based on neighbourhood deprivation levels.\nIn order to do this, and to standardise certain things to control for ‘confounding factors’ - that is, other features of neighbourhoods the effect of which we want to control for so we don’t confuse it with the deprivation effect - we created a way to express the social gradient in a single number that represents how many times we would expect the rate of child welfare interventions to increase or decrease for every one standard deviation increase in deprivation, measured by the Indices of Multiple Deprivation. A one-standard deviation difference is about the same to comparing an ‘average’ deprivation neighbourhood with one that is ranked in the middle of the third most deprived of all neighbourhoods.\nFor simplicity’s sake, I refer to a minus 1 change in standard deviation as an ‘average low deprivation’ neighbourhood, and plus one standard deviation change as representing an ‘average high deprivation’ neighbourhood. It’s best to not overthink it too much and just consider it us comparing low, average, and high deprivation neighbourhoods in a way that doesn’t mean we focus on the extremes. See the graph below for a more simple example of local authority deprivation. We scaled up the same logic to local authorities - so an ‘average high deprivation local authority’ would be one with a deprivation score one standard deviation, and did the same for ‘income inequality’.\n Image showing distribution of LA deprivation as a standardised distribution, with examples of average low-, average high-, and average deprivation.  \nWhat does that all mean? Well, it means if we had a social gradient of 2, we would be saying that ‘we would expect the rate in a high deprivation neighbourhood to be twice (2 times) as high as the rate in an average deprivation neighbourhood’. Basically, that the rates of intervention double. The multiplied change would be the same on average for the comparison between an average neighbourhood and a low-deprivation neighbourhood. This basically means that the higher the social gradient number is, the larger socioeconomic inequalities there are in that local authority.\nSo, what would we predict the social gradient to be in a local authority with high-deprivation and low-income inequality? The answer in our paper is about 1.26 for children looked after rates, and a little higher for CP plans and Children in Need rates. So, an average neighbourhood would have 1.26 times higher children looked after rates than a low-deprivation neighbourhood, and a high-deprivation neighbourhood would have 1.26 times higher children looked after rates than an average deprivation neighbourhood. This can also be read as a 26% increase.\nIn a low-deprivation, high-income inequality local authority, we calculate an average social gradient of 2.29 for children looked after rates. Meaning that we would expect the rates of children looked after to more than double when we compare average deprivation to low-deprivation neighbourhoods and high-deprivation to average deprivation neighbourhood. Again, this can be read as 129% increases in rates when comparing increases in deprivation (which is where our ‘five times greater’ comes from).\nThe shape of local income inequality\nBefore we raise a few ideas that start exploring why this might be the case, it’s important that we understand something crucial about what within-local area income inequality looks like. Paradoxically, more deprived local authorities tend to have greater within-area income inequality than less deprived local authorities. The image below shows the income distributions we used to calculate income inequality using the Gini coefficient, which ranges from 0 to 1 where 1 is completely unequal (one household gets 100% of the income) and 0 is completely equal (everyone gets an equal amount of income).\n\n Simulated gross household income distributions for local authorities in England and Wales. Income distribution estimates from CACI Ltd. Paycheck data. \n\nWhat this graph is saying is that areas with a higher proportion of the population on a low-income also tend to be more unequal; of course these areas also tend to be more deprived. Our conventional understanding of inequality tells us this shouldn’t be the case: places like Kensington and Chelsea should come out as the most unequal. They don’t for a couple of reasons: firstly, we tend to confuse wealth inequality - differences in people being able to afford huge houses or apartments and having massive amounts of money invested - with income inequality when imagining what inequality looks and feels like, despite them being two different but related things.\nSecondly, we tend to think about national or even transnational/global-level inequality when we think about inequality. Unless Jeff Bezos has developed the power of multilocation he can only, while contained within his mortal body, exist and have his income recorded (or not, whichever the case may be) in one place at a time. Millionaires and billionaires are not equally distributed to Sunderland in the same proportions as they are to Los Angeles, New York, and Inner London (or the Bahamas), and for these reasons, local area income inequality looks very different to global inequality.\nLocal area income inequality using the Gini method is therefore largely determined by the ratio of low-income households to middle-income households, rather than the presence of obscene wealth/income, as we see in our graph above. In the most unequal places (represented by the lighter shades of blue), we have a much larger proportion of ‘low-income’ households - the first ‘peak’ - but only a slightly lower proportion of ‘middle-income’ households (relative to how many more low-income households there are). This is probably because job security, hours, salaries, and so on are more standardised across the country for middle-income jobs than they are for low-income jobs. In many places, you literally cannot live in the local authority if your income is below a certain level - you might then be forced out by the housing market, or may be in receipt of comparatively large cash transfers like housing benefit that try and prevent such things from happening.\nIn sum, more income unequal local authorities (under our estimates) tend to have a bigger ratio of low-income households to middle-income households.\nLived experience gaps and organic empathy\nHow do we make sense of this effect? One particular bugbear of mine is that income inequality is often brought up as something detrimental to society but there’s comparatively little theorising about the mechanisms behind how this happens. The example below is more focused on how inequality effects might emerge in practice relationships, but there are likely far more factors that are not considered here, including how local income inequality might constrain the capacity of local authorities to provide services that support families on a low income if they aren’t able to as efficiently raise funds from the local population through council taxes, business rates, and other sources of revenue.\nLet’s imagine the position of a social worker (and other professionals in social work) in a high-income inequality and a low-income inequality local authority, based on what we know about what this means above. The salaries of social workers are probably too low in general considering the strain of the job and number of hours, but most people would agree that they fall somewhere in that ‘middle-income’ range of the distribution, especially after the newly qualified stage. They certainly would fall more under the second peak than they would under the ‘low-income’ first peak (of between £5k and £30k per year, gross, per household - keep in mind that the second peak represents total gross household income, so in many cases includes two adults, I am not suggesting that I think social workers earn £80k a year on average).\nAs discussed in the above section, paradoxically, more deprived local authorities tend to be more unequal because of the gap between the proportion of middle-income households and the proportion of low-income households. Now let’s consider what you can buy for social worker’s salary in a high-income - not wealth! - inequality local authority compared to a low-income inequality local authority.\nFor starters, a social worker can probably be much more ambitious with property, either rented or bought, if they live in, say, Sunderland instead of Kingston upon Thames. This might also translate into opportunities related to schools for their kids and the areas they live in general. Even the most deprived local authorities tend to have their own microcosm of ‘comfortable’ neighbourhoods for middle-income professionals that are found everywhere: teachers, doctors, dentists, civil servants, and social workers.\nContrast this to the options afforded to social workers who work in the less income unequal local authorities, the places that tend to be less deprived and therefore more expensive. The property market may be out of reach, or much harder to reach, which will restrict where they can live, and therefore there would likely be many parts of life that they are priced out of.\nRather than the more locally income equal places bringing up the quality of life that low- and middle-income households can afford by redistributing income from the top (which doesn’t happen in local-area equality), it squeezes all households closer together creating more ‘equality’ but probably not a better quality of life overall. The very low-income households have their incomes nudged up (either through London weighting or rent-based housing benefit), but this probably doesn’t improve peoples’ quality of life; it just props up a broken housing market. Middle-income households may have their incomes nudged up a little bit, especially with things like London weightings in affluent parts of London, but probably not nearly enough to offset the additional costs of living in an ‘affluent’ county/city.\nSo, where am I going with this? Basically, my theory is that the lived experience of a social worker - their experience with housing, where they can afford to live, class discrimination, schooling, quality of life - is probably more similar to that of the people they work with in the more ‘income equal’ local authorities, despite the fact that the way that this equality emerges is somewhat counter-intuitive and perverse. In more locally income-unequal places, middle-income households, which include many social workers, are better able to carve out a quality of life that looks very different to those of the low-income households within their city or county.\nThis, I suspect, makes it harder for some people to develop empathy, poverty-aware practice, and perhaps other things associated with child welfare inequalities organically, through living in the same places, sending children to the same schools, and facing the same financial difficulties. Through experiencing the same experiences. As social workers are burdened with more and more paperwork, the capacity to build this empathy through direct work also reduces. This may, of course, all be completely incorrect nonsense - the truth is probably a combination of many factors - but I think we have to start somewhere in understanding how inequality subtly shapes injustice in the child protection system.\nWhere from here?\nWe argue in our paper that this means that local children’s services solutions, with all the best will in the world, can never tackle socioeconomic inequalities in child welfare intervention rates on their own - neither can individual social workers. They can make strides, certainly, but there are structural patterns reinforced by national policy that create the contexts in which unequal likelihoods of intervention flourish. Local income inequality is one of these.\nAll the evidence suggests that reducing the deprivation and poverty that people face will reduce the rates of social work intervention, but this alone does not change how socially just children’s social services are - poorer neighbourhoods would still have higher intervention rates. The enormous variation in the proportion of households on a low income across the country, in contrast to much lower variation of middle-incomes, may be leading to even more unintended consequences as our material lives create figurative and literal barriers between us, sowing more inequality into all of our social engagements. This, for a profession that prides itself on human connection and relationships, should be particularly worrying.\nYou can read the full article this blog is based on here.

This is, of course, something of a simplification - it may not hold true when talking about very complex machine learning models designed for producing images or sounds - but within the context of the kinds of predictive analytics used in governance, including the algorithm that caused A-level results chaos today, it is, essentially, true.\nSomeone who has experience working with both data analysis and predictive analytics in more general programming languages can probably even name the functions required to get from one to the other. It is pretty much a given. In fact, we use predictions frequently in quantitative analysis to check whether outliers are skewing our model estimates or to visualise the impact of one variable on our outcome of interest. For example, see below how I have visualised the predicted rates of children being taken into care, classed ‘in Need’ under Section 17 of the Children Act 1989, or placed on a child protection plan, using a complex multilevel negative binomial regression model that controls for many other factors (see our paper here for full details).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Incidence rate and incidence rate ratio predictions from a set of three negative binomial models.\n\n\n\n\nThe two different applications, despite comprising of probably more than 90 per cent of the same code, tend to be used for polar opposite purposes. Building a model based on good theory, clear hypotheses, and representative data, can tell you about the inequalities that exist in the data, and in the system that produces this data. The goal is to test and understand, usually with an aim to show something that shouldn’t be happening. The model can tell you about how black people are disproportionately stopped and searched by the police, even after controlling for many other factors; it can tell you about how children living in the poorest ten per cent of neighbourhoods are ten times more likely to be taken into care; and it can tell you about how poverty and preferential treatment and resourcing of certain types of schools impacts young people’s chances of achieving the qualifications they need to pursue their goals.\nThe exact same model, with a flourish of code, can be turned into a tool for predicting what we would expect given these patterns and associations - even when we know or suspect that what the system produces is fundamentally unjust. Test and understand is no longer the primary goal. Predict as best as possible is. This is, presumably what’s happened with the great A-level results adjustment debacle today. At least, what happened hits all the right beats.\nInstead of telling us how very fundamentally unjust structures twist and distort children’s chances of having their abilities recognised, or strip them of opportunities to fully develop their skills and intellect through schooling, the use of predictive analytics and automated-decision making stands in for the unjust system and, in many cases, amplifies it. Whatever models were produced to create this disaster could have told us about how young people who live in deprived areas are unjustly robbed of the chance to fulfil their academic potential; how state-run schools are under-resourced and, as a consequence, forced to take on larger and larger class sizes. We could have even used them to level the playing field a bit for young people who face multiple disadvantages, those who we have failed in the design and resourcing of our education system.\nInstead, the predictive models made sure that the system got its due, and that those with the temerity to be born into poverty or to be born as an ethnic minority - or both - suffered the full brutality of society’s flaws. That those born with the good sense to be white, wealthy, and to parents with friends in high places, weren’t deprived of their extra slice of pie. They ensured that the tilting of the table was simulated even when the table had been thrown off the edge of a cliff.\nA part of me is an awful person, who relishes the fact that this gaming of the system through pseudo-technomancy caught in its net the same people who often benefit from these systems and do nothing to stand against, or even actively support, the rise of automated inequality that ruins the lives of millions of poor people every year. Largely, it got them because the approach the engineers (or whatever) used appeared to be geographical, not individual; I suppose they would be the “false positives” in this case. How many false positives have already been swept up by automated job application funnels, housing application filters, child protection alarms, police facial surveillance systems, and automated criminal justice sentencing tools?\nOf course, it is wrong to be happy about this because those young people have done nothing wrong. They did not deserve to have their results downgraded any more than others did, so any victory over the relentless march of ‘AI’ is pyrrhic at best. It is good that their parents are waking up to the dangers of predictive analytics, I only hope that many of them in privileged positions will recognise that this awful day for their families has been an awful decade for many others and that, when they get their way to reverse what has happened (which they will), we don’t just go back to ‘trialling’ these deeply flawed technologies on the lives of those who can’t fight back.\n\n\n\n",

(Click here to view a colourblind friendly version).\n\nA casual observer of debates in child protection is likely to be familiar with the following two observations: first, that Black children are disproportionately over-represented in the rates of children in care and, second, that poor children are disproportionately over-represented in rates of children in care. If your expertise and interest stopped there, you might conclude that the two are one and the same. More Black children are living in poverty and therefore more children in care are Black.\nYou might then, reasonably, conclude that both injustices could be tackled in one fell swoop, or at least that there is no harm in tackling each in their own realm because the end result will be a benefit to all oppressed groups. Lift all people out of poverty, or tackle structural racism, and both injustices would be remedied. An anti-racist agenda and an anti-poverty agenda, either will help all affected by child welfare inequalities. But what if the result was that action on one without the context of the other could actually worsen inequity?\nA more-than-casual observer of ethnic disparity in the child protection system will tell you that all is not as straightforward as it seems. For example, that in poor neighbourhoods, the rates of Black children in care are actually significantly lower than the rates of White children in care; and that in more affluent neighbourhoods the opposite is true. This is well documented in international literature, with the same patterns appearing in the United States and the United Kingdom. Similar patterns between people with Western coloniser heritage and indigenous heritage also appear in countries like Canada, Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand.\nIt’s important to state that this cannot be explained by different ethnic groups being more likely to experience child abuse and neglect. The Office for National Statistics report that, even before controlling for different exposure to poverty and stressors that may increase the risk of abuse or neglect, Black respondents to the Crime Survey for England and Wales were less likely to report having experienced child abuse (0.75:1), and Mixed Heritage respondents were only marginally more likely to report experiencing abuse (1.2:1). By contrast, we estimated the rates of children on Child Protection Plans or in care were, on average, 1.2 times higher for Black children than White children, and 1.6 times higher for Mixed Heritage children than White children. Plainly put, ethnic disproportionality is likely a predominantly service-side inequality, and requires social workers, policymakers, directors of children’s services, and the profession at large to examine the way that social work and wider allied agencies reproduce ethnic inequalities.\nThere are, of course, far more ethnic groups to consider than those discussed above, of which we look at eleven in a new article in Children and Youth Services Review. Here, where our words are more limited, we want to focus on the differences in rates of children in care between the Black British child populations (with African, Caribbean, and ‘Other’ heritage), the largest Mixed Heritage population in the UK (‘Mixed Heritage (Other)’), and the White British child population, to illustrate how an intersectional understanding of child welfare inequalities is essential for informing effective policy and practice responses, and how it aligns with sociological literature about class, race, and parenthood in Britain.\nEthnicity and the social gradient\nWhat we see from our data is that the social gradient, that is, the inequalities in child protection across the deprivation spectrum, differs significantly depending on ethnic population.\nTo try and quantify the social gradient, we calculate a single number that represents the multiplicative change in the rate of intervention between a neighbourhood with ‘average’ deprivation and a neighbourhood with ‘high deprivation’. This is roughly the same as splitting neighbourhoods into three groups, from least deprived to most deprived, comparing the average of the middle group with the average of the most deprived group, and answering ‘how many times more children are we likely to see experiencing an intervention in the more deprived group’. We used children’s services data for 836 Middle Super Output Areas from a representative sample of 18 local authorities in England to do this.\nFor White British child populations, the social gradient was 3.89 meaning that, on average, the rate of White British children in care in a high deprivation neighbourhood would be nearly 4 times higher than what it is in an average neighbourhood. This also works the other way around. In a ‘low deprivation’ neighbourhood the rate of children being taken into care would be only around 1/4th the rate of the average neighbourhood, or 1/15th the rate of the high deprivation neighbourhood.\nFor Black African child populations the social gradient was only 1.12 on average. In other words, the rate of children in care in a high deprivation neighbourhood would only be around 1.12 times higher than it is in an average neighbourhood. For Black Caribbean child populations the rate was 1.88 and for Black Other child populations it was 0.96, so it’s not quite as simple as saying the social gradient doesn’t exist for all Black ethnic groups. However, even in the case of Black Caribbean population, the social gradient is still less than half of what it was for White British populations.\nFor the Mixed Heritage (Other) ethnic group, the social gradient was approximately the same as the White British social gradient, but their rates were also between 1.7 and 3.4 times higher than the White British population’s at any point on the scale of deprivation; far higher than their marginally higher likelihood of reporting experiencing abuse or neglect would suggest.\nThis shows us that, when considered together, ethnic and class inequalities are far more complicated than they might first appear. But responding to these inequalities with effective anti-racist and anti-classist policy and practice requires more than just description. It requires us to understand how race and class work together to create injustice in children and families social work.\nRacialised wealth and racialised poverty\nWe argue that these inequalities emerge at least in part as a product of the way that poverty and affluence is interpreted within the contexts of ethnic/racial identity, as well as through the differing obligations found in anti-discrimination legislation, and there is a wealth of literature to this effect. Complex inequalities may arise as a result of the interplay between cultural representations of racialised class identities, histories of institutionalised racism, physical and symbolic violence directed towards interracial relationships, and the disconnect between anti-racist and anti-classist policies and practice.\nThe most straightforward example of the representation of racialised class identities comes from television and popular media. Consider, for example, programmes like Benefits Street or characters like Vicky Pollard (“Yeah, but no, but”) or Lauren Cooper (“Am I bovvered?”), and the use of the word ‘chav’. These are not just parodies of Whiteness in general, they are parodies of poor White people - particularly poor White mothers with Mixed Heritage children - that are seeped into our national consciousness. They are presented as feckless, idle, criminal, and undeserving of compassion, and are subject to many of the same stereotypes that are applied to young Black people, but there is usually limited discussion of the way that these narratives shape the treatment of young White mothers living in poverty.\nIn the space of affluence, consider the cultural representation of affluent Black people - particularly affluent Black men. Black faces are normalised in cultural representations of poverty, usually presented through the gaze of the ‘White saviour’, and the representations of routes to wealth for Black people are commonly positioned within narratives of physical over intellectual effort and ability, as well as with criminality, drug dealing, and gang violence. In other words, poverty has historically been presented as the norm for Black families, and a deviation for White families.\nBlack men in relationships with White women have been particularly vilified throughout history, along with their partners, and oppressed physically, legally (in the form of anti-miscegenation laws in the USA), and symbolically in cultural representations of their motives. The Fletcher Report in 1930 famously stated that White women in relationships with Black men were either ‘mentally weak’, ‘prostitutes’, ‘young and reckless’, or forced into marriage through pregnancy. These social attitudes are far from consigned to history. One study in the US, as recently as 2008, found that 17 per cent of White men and 19 per cent of White women responded that they thought it ‘was not a good idea’ for White men to have children with Black women or for White women to have children with Black men, respectively. A further 36 per cent of men, and 45 per cent of women, responded that they ‘wouldn’t [have children with a Black woman/man themselves], but that it was okay for others’.\nA history of institutionalised and systemic racism, racially segregated neighbourhoods, and racist cultural stereotypes coalesce into systems that place Black people under increased social surveillance and suspicion, not just by the state but by their neighbours, especially when they live in predominantly White, affluent neighbourhoods and send their children to predominantly White schools. A similar kind of surveillance exists for White mothers living in poverty, as their uses of state support - that they are entitled to - and their relationships, are closely monitored and scrutinised.\nThe Obligation Disconnect\nIn both of these examples, the interpretation of class and poverty is heavily contingent on race, and vice versa. In both, too, children of Mixed Ethnic Heritage are disadvantaged in unique ways that are rarely discussed. In law and social work education the two matters are often dealt with outside the lens of the other. Anti-racist practice has a longer history in social work education (although it remains a marginal concern), while anti-poverty or anti-classist social work practice and education has been patchwork at best.\nFurther, social class is not a protected characteristic under anti-discrimination law and, as such, there is less of an imperative for anti-classist practice to be pursued seriously; especially under strained budgets, high workloads, and the depressing regularity that tabloids and politicians accuse social workers of being ‘overly politically correct’ and obsessed with ‘isms’ and ‘ologies’.\nThis combination of sociological factors may help us better understand why there are 15 times more White British children in care in high-deprivation neighbourhoods than there are in low-deprivation neighbourhoods; why rates of care for Black children are between 3.3 and 4 times higher than White British children’s in low-deprivation neighbourhoods, but the opposite in high-deprivation neighbourhoods; and why Mixed Heritage children seem to face the sharp edge of both class discrimination and structural racism. Thinking more critically about the racialised notions of class may be essential for uncovering and rectifying hidden biases in child protection, and confronting the long shadow of racism, anti-miscegenation attitudes, stigmatisation, and our contextual interpretations of poverty is essential.\nAs yet, there is far too little good research in the UK about race, class and the care system to be certain whether our theories are correct, and the data we rely on are far from perfect. All we can do is say that our analysis helps illuminate disturbing patterns in child welfare interventions, and that these patterns are consistent with the history of racism and oppression in our society. Social work has not escaped this.\nRoutine data is still not collected on parents’ socioeconomic circumstances, and we can see our society slipping back into a reluctance to call racism by its name as the media collectively move on from the Black Lives Matter protests. We would encourage you to reflect on your thoughts and, if you are a social worker, your practice through a racialised class or intersectional lens. How do you think about young mothers living in impoverished areas and how does their ethnicity (and the ethnicity of their children) affect your interpretation? What specific training or education have you had on Whiteness, multiethnic heritage, and poverty? Are you immune from the pejorative narratives of Benefits Street and Little Britain? Why might wealth shield White British families from social work intervention, but not their Black neighbours? How might institutionalised and systemic racism in other agencies and processes associated with children’s services create ethnic inequalities in child protection?\nThe Consequences of Intersectional Injustice\nBased on our findings, what would happen if we just tackled economic inequalities without deliberate efforts to reduce ethnic inequalities? The rates of children in care would drop massively for White British and Mixed Heritage children, and a few other ethnic minority groups would see some reductions, but the rates for Black African and Black Other children would probably stay much the same. The rates for Black Caribbean children would decrease less than half the amount that they would for the White British children. The end result would be that ethnic inequalities would increase.\nHow about if we just pursued ethnic proportionality without attention to class and poverty? If you want proportionality in overall rates, Black children who are already disproportionately under-represented in poor neighbourhoods would need to be further under-represented, creating greater ethnic inequalities within similarly deprived neighbourhoods. If you want greater proportionality within similarly deprived neighbourhoods, you would, paradoxically, need to intervene more frequently with Black populations. This would increase ethnic disproportionality and the social gradient overall.\nAnd what of the Mixed Heritage children for whom inequalities will persist under either option? Under the former, there would still be a gulf of difference between them and their peers from other ethnic groups and, in the latter, the same would be evident between richer and poorer counterparts.\nThe evidence tells us that anti-racist social work should be pursued with explicit reference to the link between class and race, and that anti-poverty social work must not assume all racial disparities can be explained by economic disparity. Tackling either alone will tackle neither. The problem is extremely complex, as we discuss in the paper, but that is not an excuse to water it down or to seek shortcuts. Moreover, there are other important intersections to consider: gender, nationality, sexuality, and disability to name but a few. Perhaps we might be better served by thinking about Intersectional Justice, and how we create policies and practice to achieve this.\nAchieving Intersectional Justice\nIn order for social work to achieve racial and class justice it is necessary for it to achieve both. Resources for doing so already exist in the form of anti-oppressive practice, but it must be made clear that this kind of anti-oppressive practice cannot be achieved when racial equality and class equality are treated as separate agendas. When they are, intersectional injustice remains hidden. Moreover, these patterns are global, and that tells us that what we’re seeing is not just the result of erratic histories in place - certain groups fallen into strange relations with social services - but about the very fundamentals of how class, race/ethnicity, and poverty play out in society and the processes of social control and social ordering.\nThere must be personal commitments to unlearning racism and prejudice, critically examining whiteness, and learning how society is structured by race and class. Change requires courage and a willingness to confront and reflect on institutionalised injustices that practitioners, managers, policy makers and researchers are all caught up in and subjected to in their own lives. But responsibility must never fall solely on the shoulders of practice and practitioners.\nWe cannot naïvely assume that social workers can easily transition from current ways of working through (un)learning alone. Pursuing anti-oppressive practice makes social work more complex and more time consuming. Achieving it requires adequate resourcing of social services and investment in social work, as well as in allied causes and organisations, especially those led by people with lived experience of racism and class discrimination. It requires commitments to dismantling racism and the impact of structural inequality, not just the acknowledgment of it. And this must be done by all agencies and institutions: education, justice, welfare, and housing to name a few. If the police disproportionately target Black teenagers in areas that they ‘don’t belong’ for stops and searches, more ethnic disproportionality will emerge in social work. If schools in predominantly affluent, White areas, over-surveil their Black, Asian, and Mixed Heritage students, more ethnic disproportionality will emerge in social work.\nWhile the Black Lives Matter movement starts to see some success in their calls to defund the police and invest more into other services including social work, we must remember that social work hardly has a spotless record on racial equality, and many people do not know about the levels of ethnic disproportionality in family social work. Before I started researching children’s social services, I also held a rose-tinted view of social work. Restructuring systems of social control and order risks trading one form of oppression for another when the new system is not critically examined. If the social work profession wants to prove they deserve the trust of communities fighting for the rights of oppressed people, it needs to be upfront about its shortcomings and deliberate in its actions to confront them by moving towards social models of child protection.\nWe, as well as others, have exposed that inequalities in child protection are intersectional. We now need to see organisational and societal commitments to monitoring these intersectional inequalities and creating change, so that they are not allowed to retreat back to the shadows. In doing so, we must remember that nothing will change unless we can see it change. Be skeptical of words without action, action without results, and results without accountability and transparency. Only through vigilance will we keep a light on injustice, and in that light we can manifest change.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nClick here to go directly to the CWIP App Version 2 Beta. For a brief overview, read on…\n\nIt’s been a year since I started working on the first version of the Child Welfare Inequalities Project App. The purpose of the app was to help social workers, policymakers, local government, activists - anyone, really - with the task of representing trends and patterns in, and pulling out basic statistics from, children’s services data. Anyone familiar with the statistical releases of the Department for Education will know that they are not always the most user-friendly files, they can be hard to combine, especially over time, and it can be hard for people with limited technical or statistical knowledge to extract the information they want from them. It is even harder to turn the data that’s extracted into something engaging, like a data visualisation, and this may take much more time than an activist or advocate might have. Quite frequently, the data is archived or requires some transformation, making comparisons over time difficult.\nThe CWIP App brings together around 16 different datasets at the local authority and neighbourhood level, with a range of features including being able to adjust for deprivation effects using the results from linear models calculated ‘on the fly’; the ability to compare multiple different graphs side-by-side; and the possibility to create literally hundreds of thousands of possible graphs. Moreover, in my opinion, these graphs look beautiful (while being informative as possible), and all have a consistent theme for non-jarring implementation into any organisations’ reports. All of this is done through a UI and hosted online, which means that nothing needs to be installed and no programming knowledge is required. The CWIP App is completely free, and has been funded by the University of Sheffield. All you need is an internet connection and a computer. You don’t even need to register for an account.\nVersion 1 of the CWIP App was my first attempt at building an R Shiny application and it was, to be blunt, very clear that it was my first time. It was well received, but there was consistent feedback about its limitations; many of which I didn’t have the technical skills to overcome. The code was full of redundancies (even more than this new one!), slow, and things like data storage and transformation were inefficient. In the space of a year, not only have the R community and Shiny resources grown, but my own experience and practice using it has, including when I developed the Mapping Overlaps Gadget (the features of which are replicated here). The offline and fully featured repository for version 1 included a 4.6GB data shapefile… The entirity of this version is around 0.75GB, while containing a huge number of additional variables, and is hosted publicly on Github, where anyone can download it.\nThis means that all of the code, all of the data, everything, can be examined, scrutinized, modified, extended, and used for whatever purpose anyone wants. You can use the app and its source code for education, practice, activism or management. And any graph you produce can simply be copy and pasted elsewhere, or for interactive plots there is a ‘download plot’ link.\nWith that introduction, let’s move onto the practical matter of what features are available…\nThe Data Dashboard allows you to quickly look at trends in variables from Section 251 returns, Children Looked After statistics, and the Children in Need Census…\n\nYou can pick from two different ways of visualising trends: as a simple trend plot, or as a bar showing the proportion of the funding in a local authority against the average in England. You can also get a sense of how these differences look on a map, what the variables’ relationship with deprivation looks like, and which local authorities have the most similar values on average or trends across time, by using the accompanying plot feature.\nSpending waffle charts are an interesting way to visualise how expenditure on children’s services has changed over time…\n\nThe waffle chart option allows you to visualise expenditure per child in any local authority over the last decade, as well as the English average. Spending is represented in £20 notes, and split into three categories: spending on children looked after, spending on safeguarding (including social work), and spending on Early Help/Family Support services. This visualisation is a good way to show not only how spending has increased or decreased over time, but how the proportions of spending have changed (for more detail on this, see our paper).\nSide-by-side trend plots allow you to investigate how trends have been changing over the past decade…\n\nYou can also use this feature to compare how a trend might look if all local authorities had the same underlying level of deprivation, compared to how it looks with the underlying structural inequalities we currently have. Often, when underlying need is equalised you can find interesting sites for comparison, and in our research we’ve found that as much as 75 per cent of the variation in LA rates of intervention can be explained by underlying differences in deprivation.\nIn a similar vein, you can compare two maps side by side…\n\nYou can compare distributions of the same or different variables across the country using side-by-side maps. This can be handy for comparing distributions and changes across two time periods (if you select two different time periods, the scale will be set to the same for both), or looking at how distribution would be different if all local authorities had the same underlying deprivation. For example, there are usually more children looked after in rural and southern local authorities once the effect of deprivation is removed. You can even change the map to a Danny Dorling style cartogram, so that each local authority is represented based on the size of their child population (rather than their landmass!)\nThe app also visualises how staggering ethnic inequalities are in rates of children in care…\n\nSeveral graphs can be produced which illustrate the scale of ethnic inequalities at the local authority level, showing not only the rates of intervention per estimated 10,000 of the ethnic population, but how those look in proportion to the intervention rates for the White British population.\nCluster and Trend Cluster plots perform Hierarchical Cluster Analysis in your browser, to identify which local authorities are the most similar to one another…\n\nYou can cluster local authorities based on their similarity across any combination of variables in the CIN Census, CLA statistics, and S251 Returns. For example, you can find who had the most similar rates of children looked after to one another as well as the most similar levels of spending and referrals on average across the decade, or in one specific year. You can also cluster based on trends, for example, to find out which local authorities had seen similarly steep reductions in spending under austerity. The distance of the lines linking two local authorities reflects how dissimilar they are (roughly speaking).\nThe features from the MOG app also exist in the CWIP App version 2…\n\n\nUsing these, you can explore between 50 and 100 small area level variables within local authorities (at the children’s services administrative boundary). You can even overlay two variables to explore interesting intersections, for example, neighbourhoods with high levels of income deprivation but low levels of education, employment, and skills deprivation. These might be interesting sites to learn about how to improve services and support.\n\n\n\n",

We have just had a new article accepted in Children and Youth Services Review that extends this work further with intersectional population models, look out for an announcement on Twitter for when this is published.\nRanges are not set equal across all plots\n\n\n\nThere is a strong relationship between CLA rates and deprivation for White British child populations\n\n\n\nRates for Mixed Heritage child populations are about twice as high in an average LA, and are also strongly associated with deprivation\n\n\n\nAsian population rates are typically much lower, but this is not always the case. Our research has shown that this also differs quite substantially depending on whether you’re looking at rates for children with Bangladeshi, Pakistani, or Indian heritage.\n\n\n\nRates for Black children are almost 4 times higher than White children, on average. But there are some huge outliers, which can be seen at the bottom of the chart; these may be outliers related to unaccompanied asylum seekers, or due to poor population projections given the census is so out of date. The rates also seem to be less strongly associated with deprivation than the White British or Mixed Heritage rates.\n\n\n\nThe rate ratio plots show how the majority of local authorities have CLA rates for Mixed Heritage child populations that are higher than the rates for their White British population. On average, for every 1 White British child in care per 10,000 White British children we would expect to see around 2.16 Mixed Heritage children in care for every 10,000 Mixed Heritage children.\n\n\n\nThe rate ratio plots show how the majority of local authorities have CLA rates for Asian populations that are lower than the rates for their White British population. On average, there are around 0.6 Asian children in care for every 10,000 Asian child population for every 1 White British child in care for every 10,000 White British children.\n\n\n\nAgain, we see the strongest ethnic inequalities reflected in the Black child population, where we’d expect a CLA rate for the Black child population around 3.7 times higher than the White British rate per 10,000, on average.\n\n\n\n",

It’s taken my father’s time, my mother’s time. My uncle’s time. My brothers’ and my sisters’ time. My nieces’ and my nephews’ time. How much time do you want for your “progress?”’\nJames Baldwin, The Price of a Ticket\n\nAt several points in my very short career I have written sentences in drafts of academic journal articles that feel wrong, but not in an empirical sense. My stomach crumples and contorts in panic as I review or think about what I’ve written, like someone is tilting the cartridge of my soul. It’s the result of going against the deep desire to doubt myself, to convince imaginary detractors who, at the sniff of insurrectionary sentiment, will dismiss whatever points I might have made as the ramblings of a revolutionary. Not ‘proper’ science. I back off to the safe comfort of concluding that ‘this research has its limitations and more data is needed’.\nThe first clear sense of this feeling came from about as milquetoast a sentiment that has ever been written. In a concluding section of an article I wanted to express that children and young people were especially disadvantaged in the policy sphere because they could not vote, they had no meaningful representation, and were easy to target because they are unable to hold anyone accountable. And that, as a consequence of this, it was our responsibility to amplify their voices and draw attention to the injustices they faced.\nIn the end, I pissed away the chance to express this argument clearly by reiterating some statistics and hoping the reader would come to the conclusion I was alluding to. Like some kind of academic ‘nudge-nudge, wink-wink’. I had a sense that such things could not be said if I wanted to be taken seriously. “Children’s services have been cut more than any other service and, well - you know - it’s really not on now, is it chaps?” Epistemological Victorianism.\nPerhaps this is just a problem with me - the gutless subversive. But I feel that it goes deeper than that. There is a sense, in research and writing about research, that every finding that implies there should be a change against the status quo must be qualified with ‘but of course, more evidence is needed before we actually do anything about this’. Always ‘more evidence is needed’.\nOf course, a certain amount of this is self-preservation from an existential threat. If we don’t need any more evidence, what’s the point of me? But I feel it goes much deeper than that. We’re told that this is the way to make progress. That, if we follow the rules, do everything carefully, correctly, scientifically, then incremental change is not only logical but inevitable.\nBut the world only changes with the facts when ignoring them any longer would threaten those who benefit from the status quo. When the political ground of inaction becomes more unstable than that of action, and even then it only changes as much as needed to stop the shaking. The quantity of evidence, the quality of evidence, none of it matters much on the treadmill of justice procrastination.\nWe are kept busy collecting evidence that can be conveniently pointed to as a reason for social change to hide the fact that most of the time the only barrier to change was that the people in charge could get away with not doing it. No politician has ever sat in front of the jigsaw of policy saying ‘Yes, we must do something, but I just need that last piece of evidence!’, but they will happily say ‘Well, we hadn’t done anything about it before but in light of this new evidence…’ In many cases, the evidence has existed for years and the ‘new evidence’ becomes a convenient retrospective excuse for inaction rather than a catalyst for action.\nThere’s perhaps no better example of this than Marcus Rashford’s campaign that succeeded in creating a U-turn on government free school meals policy. Rashford’s success put the collective efforts of many social scientists over at least the last decade to shame. That is not a criticism of them, but of the relationship between evidence and politics. While people outwardly celebrated the success, I imagine many behind closed doors, myself included, felt pathetically ineffective. Some things we don’t need more evidence about. We don’t need more evidence to prove that allowing children to starve is wrong and harmful.\nI’m afraid I don’t have a satisfying conclusion to this post. I don’t have a suggestion or solution. Less trepidation in our writing and more activism, I suppose, but even that feels like a cop out when faced with systemic indifference to evidence. And, as I say, maybe this is more of a ‘me’ problem than an a ‘we’ problem.\nI would probably start by asking myself one thing every time I feel tempted to write that more evidence is needed, riffing off of the James Baldwin quote above. ‘How much evidence do you want for your progress?’ Evidence is time. Can-kicking progress and agreeing to a few more minutes on the treadmill. Most of the time more evidence isn’t needed, other than for us to justify the existence of our jobs.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\n\nBack in January 2019, the National Audit Office published a report which claimed that 44 per cent of the variance in Local Authority Child Protection Plans could be explained by ‘local authority characteristics’ other than deprivation (which could explain 15 per cent). Although they never claimed this, the finding was largely interpreted as evidence that local authority policy and practice was more important than structural disadvantage - by some magnitude. However, an analysis by myself and colleagues of the Child Welfare Inequalities Project recently published in Children and Youth Services Review found that, once deprivation and other structural factors are accounted for at the neighbourhood level, differences between local authorities shrink dramatically and in some instances practically disappear.\nThe Nuffield Foundation funded a modest extension to our original project to use some more complex modelling techniques on the data we had collected from 18 systematically chosen local authorities. These local authorities were chosen to be a representative sample of all local authorities in England, reflecting many different regions and varying levels of deprivation and ethnic makeup. For this analysis we aggregated Childen in Need, Child Protection Plan and Children Looked After records up to the Lower Super Output Area level and joined several LSOA measures onto this data. An LSOA can be thought of as a large ‘neighbourhood’, with around 1,500 people living in it. This contrasted to the NAO’s approach which, although not made transparent, seemed to use far less granular data.\nOur paper focused mostly on the magnitude of structural inequalities and the size of the Inverse Intervention Law and the Inequalities Intervention Law, but the technical appendices also contained measures of variance linked to neighbourhood local authority membership and how these changed after controlling for different structural factors. It’s these measures that I want to expand upon here, because I believe they are important for the ongoing ‘Policy and Practice’ versus ‘Structural Disadvantage’ narrative that appears so frequently.\nHow does local authority variation change before and after controlling for structural factors?\nUsing a multilevel model we were able to get a measure of local authority level variation in average neighbourhood rates of child welfare interventions. A simple explanation of this is that we calculated how much each local authority’s average neighbourhood rates of intervention differed. Before we take account of any structural factors, like deprivation or ethnicity, the variation for local authorities comes out as 0.1047. This is a ‘raw’ amount of variation between local authorities. We can get a sense of what this means if we plot all of these variations around the mean rates.\n\nIn the plot above we can see our model’s predictions for each of our 18 local authorities. The green line represents the average CPP rate across all local authorities (around 39 plans per 10,000 children). The points below the green line are local authorities with average neighbourhood rates below the average, and the points above the green line are those with higher than average rates. As you can see, there is a lot of local authority variance - some have average neighbourhood CPP rates approaching 60 children per 10,000, others have rates lower than 25 per 10,000. Surely we should rush to the local authority with much lower rates in their neighbourhoods to find out how their policies and practice differs, right?\nBefore we do so, let’s have a look at how our local authority variance changes once we control for structural factors. Structural factors are societal things that influence outcomes - like peoples’ health or exposure to risks or advantages. They are unequally distributed across local authorities, so what might look like a difference caused by local authority membership (and something specific about how that local authority does things) might actually be representing differences in structural dis/advantage. Esssentially, if we switched around the structural inequalities in local authorities we would expect the outcomes to switch around too, regardless of the local authority we’re switching from/too. The full list of structural inequalities we included in our model were:\nNeighbourhood deprivation\nLocal Authority deprivation\nEthnic density of different ethnic groups\nUnemployment levels\nInfant Mortality\nPopulation education levels\nIncome inequality\nThe ‘inverse intervention law’ and the ‘inequalities intervention law’\nThe last two structural factors require some explanation. We observed in earlier research that deprivation had a different relationship with child welfare interventions depending on how widespread deprivation was in the wider area. We also found that the same thing happened with income inequality. In short, deprivation was more strongly linked to child welfare interventions in less deprived, more unequal local authorities. So what happens to our local authority variance after we control for all of these factors?\n\n\nThe variance linked to local authority membership shrinks, from 0.1047 to 0.0039. You can see by comparing the two plots that the differences in the mean neighbourhood CPP rate linked to LA membership reduce quite remarkably after controlling for structural factors. Yes, there are still some differences we might want to investigate, but these were greatly exaggerated by a lack of structural awareness in our model. The difference between the local authority with the highest intercept is now less than double that of the local authority with the lowest intercept (by contrast, children in the most deprived 10% of neighbourhoods were over 10 times as likely to be on a child protection plan than children in the least deprived 10%)\nSo far this post has focused on child protection rates, but the differences are more profound when we look at other intervention measures like Children Looked After rates. Looking at the plots below, you can see how local authority variance practically disappears in average neighbourhood Children Looked After rates after we control for the same structural factors. Efforts to reduce local authority differences in Children Looked After rates are doomed to fail if they ignore structural contexts of poverty and ethnic inequality.\n\n\n\n\n\nShould we ignore local authority differences in policy and practice?\nNo. Our interpretation of the findings should not be as simplistic as that. There are clearly some differences in certain practice areas, however overstated these may be when we aggregate data up as far as the local authority level. Furthermore, the Inverse Intervention Law and the Inequalities Intervention Law demonstrate that the same structural disadvantage can result in very different child welfare inequalities depending on the local authority context, which we explored in more detail in our published paper.\nWhat the evidence does suggest is that it is misleading and incorrect to claim the majority of differences in child welfare inequalities are down to local authority policy and practice.\nOur research shows that what is important is the space where local authority policy and practice meets structural inequality; how well local children’s services can respond to, alleviate, and challenge structural disadvantage, and the extent to which structures can support and enable positive local policies and practice. It is not a case of one or the other, structural disadvantage or practice and policy, but both in relation to one another. As such, the most effective changes to children’s services are likely to be found in those approaches that merge effective child protection policy and practice within a structural inequalities perspective.\nThis post was written by me in a personal capacity and does not necessarily represent the views of the wider CWIP team nor of our funders or employers.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nPhoto from Unsplash\nIn 2018, Paul Bywaters and I published a paper about the funding of children’s services under the austerity years of the coalition government (open access repository version here). The headline finding from this research was that the term ‘decimated’ was a huge understatement for describing what had happened to funding for family support and early help between 2010 and 2015. Resources available to local authorities for providing these services could more accurately be described as having been obliterated, and that the cuts were far worse in the most deprived local authorities.\nA finding that received less attention was that the funding formula for children’s services had not only been simplified, but had been quietly changed from something with more ‘absolute’ components to a purely ‘relative’ formula. Before 2012, the formula used a way of determining funding that multiplied specific amounts by needs-related factors in a local authority (DCLG, 2010: 7-10). Despite calling itself a ‘Relative Needs Formula’ and having an upper ceiling on funding, this reflected a far more absolute level of need in each local authority.\nAfter 2012, amongst other direct cuts, the funding formula was made more relative, where the proportion of a local authorities level of need relative to other local authorities was calculated first before being multiplied by the total grant funding available, obscuring the real amount of need that would go unmet (DCLG, 2013: 45-47). To our knowledge, these changes flew mostly under the radar. Perhaps because local government financing is hardly the most thrilling of tasks.\nBaking the pie and slicing the pie: the difference between relative and absolute approaches to funding\nImagine for a moment that each local authority is a dinner guest, the need for children’s services is their level of hunger, and the funding of these services is a pie. The DCLG and Treasury, in this instance, play the role of the baker.\nAn absolute formula is primarily concerned with creating a large enough pie that every guest’s hunger is sated equitable to their level of hunger. If the first guest says that 800g of pie is enough to satisfy their hunger, another that 400g is enough, and a third that believes 200g would suffice, the baker will create a pie that weighs 1,400g in total and then distribute it according to each person’s reported hunger - guest one gets 800g of pie, guest two gets 400g, and guest three gets 200g. In this form, the formula serves the purpose of informing the baker of how much pie is needed and how it should be distributed. It equitably satisfies the needs of the table.\nIn a purely relative formula, the only concern is apportioning a pie of pre-defined weight to the same people. The size of the pie is already decided. Regardless of whether the requested amounts are 800g, 400g, and 200g or 1,600g, 800g, and 400g, each of our dinner guests will receive an identical amount of pie should the proportions stay the same, even if in the latter context it is clearly insufficient to satisfy their hunger. The only concern is each guest’s hunger relative to the others, not the total hunger around the dinner table. The only thing that matters in a purely relative funding formula is the slicing of the pie, not the baking, and making sure everyone leaves feeling well-fed plays no part in your decision on how much you’re going to cook.\nFurther, this relative approach will do less not more to satisfy the hungriest of our guests. If the pie were a predefined 1,000g split in a 8:4:2 ratio the hungriest of our guests would received around 570g of pie (230g less than their hunger requires) and the least hungry would receive around 140g (60g less than their reported hunger requirement). The person most in need of pie (insofar as anyone is in need of pie) is the most disadvantaged by the relative approach. This is the same reason why we found the most deprived local authorities had been the most disproportionately affected by funding cuts.\nFixing the funding formula\nThis is the biggest problem in the funding of children’s services. Efforts to improve equitability of funding are laudible, but will never improve the position of children’s services if they remain linked to a purely relative funding formula. A more fundamental question needs to be asked about the purpose that a funding formula serves. Yes, it should equitably distribute funding to those most in need, but this should not be its primary purpose.\nThe purpose a funding formula should serve is to gauge the total need for services, calculate how much this should cost to meet, and ensure that adequate funding is in place to meet this need. Should the political will - and it is a lack of political will, not a lack of economic means - to fund services to the required amount fall short we must know explicitly how short it has fallen by.\nThe further we refuse to engage with the absolute amount of funding that is required to meet the needs of communities, the more harm we cause. It is a mathematical fact that the larger the gap between the resources needed and the resources provided is, the more inequitable a relative funding formula becomes, regardless of how accurate its proportioning is.\n\n\n\n",

You can see the result below (extra large image available here.) The dendrogram in particular made use of a very interesting package in development called cuttlefish.

The descriptions of each can be found in the link above.\nIf I was trying to market myself and the visualisation better I would say something incorrect but eyecatching like: Using AI to Choose Perfect Pairings of Songs.\nDescribing the visualisation\nThe visualisation above is made of two parts: a polar coordinates scatterplot showing the relative high and low features of each song in terms of its tempo, valence, acousticness, speechiness, loudness, energy, and danceability (from the outermost to the innermost circle). That means that, for example, songs with large diamonds on the outermost circle have the highest tempos, songs with small or no diamonds have the lowest. Songs with larger diamonds in the next circle inwards are relatively happier or cheerful. And so on.\nThe second part of the visualisation is the ‘tree branches’ that go from the outside in. At the lowest level, each one of these branches (the twigs) is linked to only this song. The two songs with the most similar audio features are then linked together in the next branch up, and then these pairs are linked to the next song or pair of songs. This continues until all of the songs are linked.\nThis type of graph is called a dendrogram, and we usually see them in evolutionary biology. For example, below is a dendrogram from the Institute of Canine Biology showing the similarities between different dog breeds.\n\nCode for creating data visualisation\nRather than breaking down each part of the code below I’m just going to outline the reasons behind each part:\nFirst I read in the data and remove the duplicates using a combination of track name and artist. Then I filter out the genre that I want to create the visualisation for. The real upper limit for a plot like this is around 200 data points, especially when song names are long. Lastly I create a new variable that takes the track year from the album release date (it extracts the first four characters of the string and makes the result a numeric type column)\nNext, I found from playing around that the popularity skewed way too heavily towards more recent releases. To try and remedy this a little I used a linear model with release year included as a set of dummy predictors, with 2019 as the reference year. I use broom to tidy up the results of this model and then get the track years back from the term column to use for a join later on. I then subtract those coefficients to rebalance the popularity by adjusting for the average drop in popularity in years past. I find this gives a much better view of “most popular, timeless” songs that makes be feel less old. Finally, I rank the tracks and keep only the top 200 - I accept any of the ties as well so it’s sometimes more or less than 200.\nNext we create a data frame that can be used to calculate a distance matrix, calculate said matrix, and run a hierarchical cluster analysis. We then extract the clusters and get them in a format that can be handled by ggplot using the amazing ggdenro package.\nNext there is a bunch of fiddly stuff to get the angles on the text labels correct and to specify a nice neon colour palette for the feature plotting. I also need to set constants to put the feature rings in the right place on the plot (which required going back to the axis scale a few times).\nLast fiddly things are to set quantiles for each of the audio feature variables and add an empty row and point to stop the overlap that seems to often happen at the start and end of the plot (both at 12’o clock). This makes the variation more visible (you’ll see I also experimented with just scaling the variable, but the differences are too obscured at such a small size).\nFinally we can plot the data. Note the important polar coordinates and reverse y scale arguments. Also note that I’ve set a very small limit for the amount that size is allowed to fluctuate (for the audio feature rings). The largest feature data points still need to be quite small to look nice and be informative.\nThe full code for the EDM visualisation is below: you can change what genre is visualised by just changing the filter conditions at the start of the code chunk.\n\n\n# Script v2 extended and with year of release weighting\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggdendro)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(mltools)\n\n# data\nspotify_songs <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-01-21/spotify_songs.csv')\nunique(spotify_songs$playlist_genre)\n\nspotify_songs\n\n\n# Filter out duplicates and select genre, extract year, remove zero popularity songs\nspotify_songs <-  spotify_songs %>% \n  filter(!duplicated(paste(track_name, \" -
